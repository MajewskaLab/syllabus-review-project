Course objectives: 
• To increase student understanding of the ecological structure and function of freshwater systems. We will accomplish this goal by studying the basic physics, chemistry, and biology of lakes and streams and becoming familiar with many of the techniques used in aquatic ecological research. 
• To increase student understanding of current threats to freshwater ecosystems. We will accomplish this goal by studying the ways in which freshwater ecosystems are potentially degraded using the assigned readings in the text and the peer-reviewed literature (see below).
• To learn the skills needed to become a proficient scientific writer and communicator. The expectation is that when finished with the course, students will be confident in conducting and analyzing freshwater ecological research and be capable of communicating the results of their work.

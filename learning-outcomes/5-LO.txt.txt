At the end of this course, you will be able to:

Apply the basic scientific principles in cellular and molecular biology to real-world situations such as evaluating how healthful a certain food is, deciding if you should get genetic testing to tell if you are at risk for a common disease like heart disease, or how to evaluate the news about global climate change. 

Identify and evaluate valid sources of scientific information.

Discern and analyze that information to make everyday decisions.
  
Model the process whereby researchers test a scientific claim, including composing a valid scientific argument. 
 
Integrate ideas and communicate your understanding about biology with others in a format which: is adapted to particular circumstances and audiences; addresses issues in the context of the larger community and environment; and allows you to apply societal ethics to scientific inquiry and findings.  

Learn about yourself, learn to work effectively with others in a group, and develop and cultivate an interest in current science issues.

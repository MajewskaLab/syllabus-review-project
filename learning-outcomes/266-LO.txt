Course Objectives and Goals:
 To identify and compare general theory, site formation processes, basic archaeological field techniques, and the disciplines that contribute to zooarchaeology, particularly as they apply to zoological evidence of human/environmental relationships.
 To identify and compare strengths and weaknesses in the materials, methods, and techniques used in zooarchaeology.
 To identify and compare the contributions zooarchaeology makes to studies of the relationships between humans and their environments and to the studies of current environmental issues by documenting historical trends.
 To practice professional level research skills needed to do lab-based research in archaeology and zooarchaeology. These skills include: 1) identification of mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, and fish remains, 2) quantification of archaeofaunal remains using common zooarchaeological methods, and 3) interpretation of the results in terms of human behaviour and environmental relationships.

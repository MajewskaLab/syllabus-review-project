Students who have successfully completed the course will have 
- demonstrated their understanding of microbiology culture techniques to isolate novel environmental organisms
- identify them using molecular methods
- use selective and differential media to isolate and identify local aquatic pathogens
- evaluate antibiotic resistance in bacteria
- determine the genetic basis of this antibiotic resistance
- observe and quantify the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes between bacteria
- isolate novel bacteriophages from environmental sources and evaluate their host specificity

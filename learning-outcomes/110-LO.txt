Students will be expected to master fundamental facts, understand their experimental underpinnings, and be able to demonstrate that knowledge by constructing and evaluating previously unvisited experiments. Specifically, students will:
• Learn how development occurs in embryos of several species of animals, primarily those with well-characterized embryology and/or genetics (Drosophila, C. elegans, zebrafish, chicken, and mouse)
• Learn the experimental strategies and tools used by developmental biologists.
• Analyze embryology experiments to identify common elements of the scientific process (hypothesis, experiment, result, and conclusion). Learn skills in scientific critiquing and creativity.
• Learn to summarize and synthesize scientific papers, and effectively communicate their findings.
• Appreciate the value of basic research in allowing leaps in our knowledge of human disease.

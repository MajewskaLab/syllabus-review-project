Evolution is the major organizing principle of all the life sciences. The field of evolutionary biology is an 
active one, with applications in agriculture, medicine, conservation, computer science, and industry. Darwin’s 
description of evolution by natural selection is one of the key intellectual achievements of humanity and all 
educated people should understand its basic concepts. The course goals are: to introduce you to the principles 
of evolutionary biology, including population genetics and macroevolution; to demonstrate the application of 
evolution to other fields through the use of case studies; to help you understand the mathematical 
underpinnings of evolution through practice; to have you understand the four basic evolutionary forces; and, 
to appreciate the processes that led to the generation of earth’s biodiversity.

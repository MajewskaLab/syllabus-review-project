In each class period there are content and skills you are responsible 
for learning. These are called learning objectives. Exams are designed to assess the 
degree to which you have achieved these objectives. Each class period I will specify the 
objectives for the day. Use these as a guide after class each day and in preparation for 
exams. Simply reading the learning objectives to determine if you understand them is 
unlikely to prepare you to pass exams in this class. Instead, take time to write out full 
paragraphs in answer to each learning objective and work with your colleagues to 
compare and improve your ability to address each objective

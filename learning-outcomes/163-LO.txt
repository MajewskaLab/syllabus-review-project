 The goals of the course are as follows:
(i) To understand what biodiversity is, how it is measured and valued, and how biodiversity changes through time via speciation and extinction.
(ii) To recognize the principal current threats to biodiversity, and how these threats are mitigated.
(iii) To understand the practice and complexity of preserving biodiversity and ecosystem function through a multi-disciplinary lens and applied case studies.
(iv) To be familiar with how species are monitored, and actions taken to maintain the viability of threatened populations

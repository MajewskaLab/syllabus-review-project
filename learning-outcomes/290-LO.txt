To introduce an area of active research in contemporary biology, with emphasis on experimental data.
To provide sufficient background for students to understand various theories for causes of aging, and thereby introduce them to (or remind them of) important biological principles.
To introduce the utility and limitations of model systems (diverse animals, yeast and cell cultures) as a means of analyzing complex biological phenomena such as aging.
To help student appreciate the diversity of responses to the passage of time, within individuals and among individuals.
To help students recognize fallacious generalizations about aging.
To demonstrate the impact of whole genome sequences, microarray technology and RNAi on our understanding of aging. 
To use aging studies as case histories for understanding methods and limitations of biological research.
To prepare students to remain critical readers of both popular and scientific articles on aging.
To teach students to avoid teleology when presenting evolutionary arguments 
To illustrate that as scientific knowledge increases, old hypotheses/theories are abandoned and replaced.

Students will be expected to master fundamental facts, understand their experimental underpinnings, and be able to demonstrate that knowledge by constructing and evaluating previously unvisited experiments. Specifically, students will:
1.	Learn the molecular and genetic mechanisms that control pattern formation, morphogenesis and growth in vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms (Drosophila, C. elegans, zebrafish, frog, chicken, and mouse), and how these organisms inform our understanding of human embryology.
2.	Understand the mechanisms by which the diverse of body forms in the animal world have evolved.
3.	Understand the experimental strategies and tools used by developmental biologists.
4.	Explain how disruption of the mechanisms of development can cause human disease.
5.	Analyze embryology experiments to identify common elements of the scientific process (hypothesis, experiment, result, and conclusion).  Learn skills in scientific critiquing and creativity.
6.	Describe the mechanisms by which the diverse of body forms in the animal world have evolved.

A demonstrated understanding of 
(1) the mechanisms by which populations change over time (selection); 
(2) the evolutionary outcomes of selection, including the relationships among different groups of 
organisms;
(3) how populations interact with both their abiotic (e.g. habitat and climate) and biotic (e.g. 
mates, competitors, predators) environment; and 
(4) the basics of animal form and function.

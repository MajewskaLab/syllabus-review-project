A major goal of this course is for you to develop the skills that will allow you to critically read/analyze anycomplex scientific literature, and to discuss such literature productively with peers. Toward this end you will learn to:
• Use concept mapping to relate new ideas (paper topics) with previous information you have learned, and to review fundamental content that underlies the papers
• Use sketching to visualize what went on in the lab. Before you begin to analyze data, you need to understand where the data came from.
• Use annotation to familiarize yourself thoroughly with what is being illustrated in the graphs, charts, photomicrographs or tables
• Use templates (to be provided) to trace the logic of particular studies and define hypotheses being tested or questions being asked.
• Learn to design experiments
• Learn to intelligently criticize experimental designs of others, in grant panels
• Learn to devise and justify a multistep research follow-up to the papers we read.
• Learn to take an aggressive approach to complex reading; looking up unfamiliar words and paraphrasing complex sentences for example
• Learn about “the people behind the papers” (i.e. the authors) and get insight into why scientists choose research careers

Students will gain an understanding of the following concepts relating to human genetics: the human genome; patterns of inheritance and pedigree analysis; mapping and identification of disease genes; molecular, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms of genetic disease; animal models of human genetic disorders; genetic basis for phenotypic variation, and ethical issues. 
Students will gain on understanding of methods and experimental approaches used to dissect molecular processes involved in human disease and phenotypic variation. Successful students will have developed a strong foundation for continued medical studies and/or research in biomedical sciences at the graduate level.

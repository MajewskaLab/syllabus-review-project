\f0\i\fs22 \cf0 Helping you master the facts, principles and scientific thinking skills for organismal biology. \
\
Critical thinking and step-by-step working through complex processes are key elements in this class. \
\
Memorization of factual knowledge is a necessary prerequisite, but to do well you will also have to master higher-level learning skills such as application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.\
\
A demonstrated understanding of (1) how the interactions between organisms and their physical environments will modify their structures over evolutionary time (by natural selection), leading to the organismal diversity we see today, (2) how living organisms create and maintain a functioning internal environment even when the external environment undergoes dramatic changes, (3) how different organisms faced with the same problem may have evolved quite different solutions (function depends on structure), (4) that all these different solutions are often based on common\
principles, and (5) how the survival and reproduction of individual organisms is affected not only by their\
interaction with their physical (e.g. habitat, climate), but also with their biological (e.g. mates, competitors,\
predators) environment, and (6) how these interactions shape the earth\'92s ecosystems.}

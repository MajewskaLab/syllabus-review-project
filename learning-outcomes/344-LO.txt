Upon successful completion of the course, students should understand:  
1) basic neurophysiology with an emphasis on synaptic transmission, 
2) principles of pharmacology, 
3) behavioral  and molecular methods commonly employed in psychopharmacology research, and  
4)  the function and neuroanatomy of the major neurotransmitter systems. With this background, students should understand the effects of all major psychoactive drugs on consciousness and behavior through their specific actions on neurotransmitter systems.  Students should also be able to comprehend and critically evaluate original research reports from the psychopharmacology literature.

Specifically, by taking this course, you will be able to: 
• Explain basic ecological principles (e.g., biodiversity and ecosystem function, climate change, competition, disturbance, evolution, pollution, succession, thermodynamics/ecosystem energetics, and trophic food web interactions) and apply these concepts to visited field sites using a place-based lens;
• Compare and contrast the ecological systems in different regions, including how the abiotic environment shapes biotic communities and their adaptations;
• Appraise how the distribution of water, mineral, soil, and vegetation resources across the U.S. has shaped past and current human occupation of different ecosystems and affected human-environment interactions; and
• Apply your understanding of current environmental challenges to propose possible solutions to help mitigate current and future environmental problems.

One of our most important goals is to get you to think like a scientist by considering not just what we know, but how we know it. Thus, learning how to extract, organize, analyze and evaluate information found online, in popular media, peer-reviewed literature, or statistics and graphs is a central theme of the course. We hope that such skills can then not only be applied to other scientific pursuits but also in many other parts of your lives.

Students will understand:
- How bacteria are integrally related to both human health and disease 
- How host defenses respond to bacteria and can contribute to disease
- The process of bacterial pathogenesis from both molecular and physiological perspectives
- Experimental approaches to define bacterial pathogenesis
- The activity of antimicrobials and how resistance arises in pathogens
- Vaccine design
- The mechanisms by which new pathogens emerge
Students will be able to:
- Critically read research literature and interpret experimental data on bacterial pathogenesis
- Design experimental approaches to define virulence factors and pathogenesis pathways
- Identify the bacteria causing disease and predict the progression of disease based on identified virulence factors and/or symptoms
- Prepare for meaningful community engagement and to reflect on the engagement experience 
- Effectively communicate with the general public on issues relating to science and health

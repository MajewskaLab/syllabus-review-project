A demonstrated understanding of (1) the mechanisms by which genetic information is utilized through transcription and translation; (2) the mechanism by which genetic information is transmitted to daughter cells through DNA replication and mitosis; (3) how the process of meiosis and sexual reproduction leads to predictable outcomes for offspring phenotypes; and (4) how genetic variation is measured in a population and the mechanisms by which the frequency of alleles change over time, resulting in evolutionary change and, ultimately, to speciation. }

This course aims to support your learning of core ideas in biology, with an emphasis on 
genetics, evolution, and molecular biology. Obviously, we will only be able to cover a tiny 
proportion of what we know about these topics, so you should see this course not only as an 
introduction to biology but also as a place where you can develop lifelong analytical and 
scientific thinking skills that will enable you to continue your learning beyond this course. This 
class is NOT a traditional science course in which you listen quietly to lectures, feverishly write 
notes, and then memorize your notes for the exams. That sort of class does a great job 
preparing you to regurgitate facts on exams, but after college you will rarely be asked to take 
exams. A primary objective of this class is to prepare you to think scientifically, which 
requires going beyond memorizing information

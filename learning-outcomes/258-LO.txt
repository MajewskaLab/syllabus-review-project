After completion of this course you will have a foundation in the logic and methods of molecular genetics, and will be better equipped to understand new advances in this dynamic field. Specific objectives are to:
•	Learn how scientists connect genes to biological functions and develop your own critical thinking skills for approaching genetic problems.
•	Deepen your knowledge of the genetic processes that underlie biological phenomena, and the diverse forms of genetic regulation. 
•	Improve your ability to read, understand, and critically evaluate primary research articles on which our understanding of biology is based.

We will 
(1) consider the philosophical questions that humans have long posed about perception, and study the methods and techniques scientists use to try to answer them; 
(2) debunk common misconceptions related to sensory systems and phenomenological experiences; 
(3) study the sensory pathways, fundamental perceptual processing, and higher-level system functionality; 
(4) investigate the many human sensory systems including vision, audition, gustation, olfaction, tactile sensation, nociception, temperature perception, proprioception, vestibular system, exteroception, and time perception; and
(5) consider sensation and perception from physiological, psychophysical, ecological, motivational, and computational perspectives in order to have the diversity of information to examine multi-sensory perceptual processes
Think like a sensation and perception researcher!
o Gain a general understanding and appreciation of sensory/perceptual systems.
o Have an understanding of the general anatomy, processes, and functions of different systems.
o Be able to engage in meaningful discussions of current approaches to sensation and perception.
o Understand the role of theories and models in the study of sensation and perception.
o Understand how models are used to generate new psychological knowledge.
o Understand how experimental data relate to theories and models of sensory/perceptual processes.
 Discriminate between “good science” and “bad science”
o Learn how to critically analyze research and apply this information to a variety of scenarios.
o Learn how to use this information to positively affect your day-to-day life

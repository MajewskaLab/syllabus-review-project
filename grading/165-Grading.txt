Make-up policy Students may miss any one of the three mid-term exams for any reason (sickness, travel, transportation issues, death in the family, etc.) without any penalty. In the event that a student completes all three mid-term exams, the lowest mid-term exam score will be dropped. The same policy applies to reading and homework assignments. In this case, the lowest 2 homework assignments will be dropped, and students can miss 1 reading assignment

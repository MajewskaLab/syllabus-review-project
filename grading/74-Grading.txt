If you are going to miss a quiz or other assignment due to illness, authorized representation of the University, or other personal circumstances, you must notify me as soon as possible and provide documentation for your absence. You may use this absence as your dopped score. Make-up quizzes will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Unexcused late submissions are not acceptable and will result in a score of zero (0) being entered for that assignment/quiz.

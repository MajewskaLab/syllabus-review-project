Make-up lab exams will only be given when a student cannot attend any of the lab sections to take the exam at the scheduled time and has a documentable excuse for this absence (page 1).  The make-up exam will be different from the one given at the scheduled time. You must contact your TA within 48 hrs following the scheduled exam to request a make-up lab practical. After this time, no make-up exams will be given and you will receive a zero for that exam.  
Grading Issues:  If you feel your exam has a grading error, you have one week from the time the exams are handed back to contest the grading. Your request must be made in writing and directly to your TA.  You must clearly state why you think you deserve credit for your answer.  If you do not contest grading during this period, the grade will stand as is. If you are not satisfied with the TAâ€™s re-grade response, then contact Dr. Dustman (for a complete re-grade of the exam).

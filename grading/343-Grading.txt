Assignments must be turned in at the beginning of class on the date due.  Late submissions will not be accepted or graded.  If you must miss class on the date the assignment is due, please arrange with a classmate to turn them in for you.  

Make-up exams will not be given unless appropriate written documentation of an emergent situation (e.g., a doctorâ€™s note) can be provided within seven (7) days of the missed exam. I reserve the right to use a different form of assessment in these situations (e.g., essay or oral examination).

Students can miss any one of the three exams for any reason without any penalty. In the event that a student completes all three exams, the lowest exam score will be dropped. Make-up exams will only be allowed in an instance where a student experiences very serious personal illness or an immediate family emergency on the date of the exam and who meet all of the following requirements: 1) Student must notify the TA of the reason for their absence prior to the exam, 2) Student must provide official documentation of serious personal illness or immediate family emergency, and 3) if the documentation is confirmed, the make-up exam will be taken at the earliest possible date following the scheduled exam. The exam may differ from the class exam, and may be entirely essay based.
We are providing opportunities to enhance your grade (i.e., dropped exam score). Therefore, all grades are final and cannot be rounded up at the end of the semester.

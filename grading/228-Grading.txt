Students will be allowed to drop their lowest exam score excluding the final (in other words, I will drop the lowest of the first three exams). The final exam cannot be dropped and students must take the comprehensive final exam. If you are absent on a test day (for whatever reason), then the resulting zeroes will be the one dropped. There will be no make-ups.

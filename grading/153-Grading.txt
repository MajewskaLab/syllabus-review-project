Grading will be determined by a final laboratory practical exam, a final written exam, a natural history formal presentation, quality and completeness of journal, and overall preparation and professionalism. The written exams will be short answer and essays. Questions will be written to assess your ability to synthesize the material presented in class and during all field locations, including travel time. You will be tested on material from the lectures, course text, and any discussion.

No Makeup Exams: Students are not permitted to make up any lecture exam, regardless of the excuse. Students missing a lecture exam may take the optional comprehensive final exam to replace this missing score. 
Once graded and posted to eLC, you will be able to review your exam in person by signing up to review your exam during office hours, in my office. Opportunities for exam review during office hours are limited.
Students who do not make an appointment to review their exam will not be allowed to review their exam.
Students may use their score from the optional final exam to replace an exam that was missed, or to replace their lowest exam score.
If you miss class, you will miss the quiz. Likewise, students who arrive late to class (or who leave early) may miss the quiz that day. Students who miss class, or who attend class but miss the quiz may not make it up.  
If you receive a grade that you believe is in error, you may challenge the grade in writing. You must submit to me the question, the answer you originally submitted, the answer which received full credit, and brief explanation detailing your reasons for requesting an increase in your score. I will only consider written requests.

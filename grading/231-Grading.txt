No make-up assignments will be given under any circumstances
Make-up exams will not be given under any circumstances. One examination from the four  will be dropped at the end of the semester, so it is advisable not to “plan” a drop examination. Save the drop examination in case of emergency. If no examinations need to be dropped by the final examination session, the final can be exempted.

Grades will not be rounded up, nor will your grade be changed at the end of the course because you need it to be higher. If you are having problems during the course with the material or the grades you are achieving please come and see me immediately and we will brainstorm how best to help you.
As a general rule, quizzes CANNOT be made up.

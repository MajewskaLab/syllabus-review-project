\f0\fs20 \cf2 There will be no extra credit or bonus points given in this lab course.  Historically, students who attend their lab classes, prepare for lab on a weekly basis, and turn in all of their written work on time, earn good grades for their efforts.\
\
You should keep a record of all your lab grades and save your graded papers until the end of the semester. 
\f1\b ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT A GRADE MUST BE BROUGHT TO YOUR GLA\'92s ATTENTION, IN WRITTEN FORM WITH A THOROUGH EXPLANATION AS TO WHY YOU DISAGREE WITH THE GRADE, WITHIN ONE WEEK OF THE GRADE BEING POSTED.  
\f0\b0 Under no circumstance will a grade be changed after the last day of classes.\

A missed exam is scored as a zero unless you have a medical excuse from a doctor that says you could not attend class or an official excuse to attend a University-sanctioned activity. You must have an acceptable excuse (as described above) for every day you do not take the makeup exam. Any falsification of excuses will be reported as a violation of the academic honesty policy. If you arrive for an in-class or final exam after another student has left the exam period, you may NOT take the exam and cannot take a makeup exam, unless an acceptable excuse is provided. 
Re-grading must be requested in writing with an explanation of the reason that re-grading is needed; e.g. why you think your answer is correct, points were incorrectly added, etc. You have 7 days after the exam is returned to request a re-grade (give request to Dr. Karls).

I generally do not accept late assignments or quizzes or allow makeups. Due to the online nature of the course, it is important to try and keep on schedule, or you may quickly fall behind. All quizzes, assignments, and tests are available for an extended period of time with recommended and required completion deadlines. However, on the last day of the class I will allow each student to either submit an assignment that they missed the first time around OR re-do an assignment if they feel they can improve it. There are no late or makeup quizzes or exams.

No make-ups for the regular exams will be given! If you donâ€™t obtain an excused absence, the missed exam will be scored as a zero. Don't forget, only your top three scores from the four exams will be used to determine your grade.
Graded exams will be scanned and PDFs will be returned electronically. Requests for re-grades must be made to me within 48 hours of the exam PDFs being released. With your request, you must give a brief explanation of the reason for the request (e.g. points were not totaled correctly, and why you think your answer(s) should be considered correct). At my discretion, the entire exam, not just the requested question(s), may be re-graded.

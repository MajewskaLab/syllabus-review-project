Your grade will be based on a midterm exam and a comprehensive final exam, case studies, class presentations/discussions, assignments/quizzes, and lab notebook assessment. All due dates and times are final â€“ journal article summaries, class presentations/discussions, assignments/quizzes, lab notebook assessment, or exams turned in after due date/time will be scored a zero. A make-up lab exam will only be given when a student cannot take the exam at the scheduled time and has a documented excuse for this absence. The make-up exam will be different from the one given at the scheduled time and may include an oral or an essay exam and will cover any previous class material, without regard to particular study guides that may have been given. A WRITTEN EXCUSE is REQUIRED for all make-up exams. In the case of severe illness or family emergency, you must inform and email the instructor prior to the exam. In addition, present/show documentation from a medical facility that indicates you could not take the exam on the date in question.
An unexcused absence will result in a grade of zero. An absence will be counted as unexcused if the instructor is not notified before the exam is given. If you believe there has been a grading error on your exam, questions about grading must be submitted in writing within one week of the return of the exam. To request a regrade, email the instructor a Word or pdf document that gives the question number and the answer with supporting evidence from the lab manual or lecture notes that proves your answer is correct. Be sure to include the exam number and your name in the file name.

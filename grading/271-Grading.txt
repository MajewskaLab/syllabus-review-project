If you miss an exam (unexcused), that is scored as a zero.  Make-up exams for excused absences must be arranged with Dr. Karls well in advance for University-approved absences or the day of return from an illness (Doctorâ€™s excuse must cover the day of the exam).   Exams may have a mix of short answer, discussion, multiple choice, and fill-in tables.  You must use a pen to take the exams or you cannot request a re-grade. Re-grading must be requested in writing with an explanation of the reason that re-grading is needed.  You have 7 days after the exam is returned to the class to request a re-grade (turn in your request to the TA).

Attendance at exams is MANDATORY. If you miss an exam for whatever reason (e.g. car trouble, jury duty, illness, family emergency), that will be your drop exam. Remember, you get to drop only one of the first three exams, with your final grade being based on the remaining three exams. There will be no exceptions to this policy and no make-up exams will be given.

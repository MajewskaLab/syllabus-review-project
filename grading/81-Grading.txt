Quizzes will not be returned. Answers will be discussed immediately following the quiz. If you believe there has been a grading error on your quiz you have one week from the date the quiz grade is posted to contact us for grade changes. No grades will be changed after this date. Make-up exams: There will be no make-up exams for missed quizzes. Instead, all students have the option of taking a cumulative ‘Optional Final’ at the end of the course. This optional final can be used to replace any quiz grade.

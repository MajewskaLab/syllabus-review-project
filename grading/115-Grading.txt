Late submissions will not be accepted. All due dates and times are final â€“ journal article summaries, class presentations/discussions, assignments/quizzes, or  date/time will be scored a zero. Make-up exams will come from a test bank and may not reflect the material emphasized in lecture. A WRITTEN EXCUSE is REQUIRED for all make-up exams. In the case of severe illness or family emergency, you must inform and email the instructor prior to the exam. In addition, present/show documentation from a medical facility that indicates you could not take the exam on the date in question. An unexcused absence will result in a grade of zero. An absence will be counted as unexcused if the instructor is not notified before the exam is given. If you believe there has been a grading error on your exam, questions about grading must be submitted in writing within one week of the return of the exam. To request a regrade, email the instructor a Word or pdf document that gives the question number and the answer with supporting evidence from textbook or lecture notes that proves your answer is correct. Be sure to include the exam number and your name in the file name.

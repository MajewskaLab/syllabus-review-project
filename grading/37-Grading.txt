There will be no extra credit or bonus points given. Historically, students who attend their lab classes, prepare for lab on a weekly basis, and turn in all of their written work on time, earn good grades for their efforts. You should keep a record of all your lab grades and save your graded papers until the end of the semester. ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT A GRADE MUST BE BROUGHT TO YOUR GLA\'92s ATTENTION, IN WRITTEN FORM WITH A THOROUGH EXPLANATION AS TO WHY YOU DISAGREE WITH THE GRADE, WITHIN ONE WEEK OF THE GRADE BEING POSTED. Under no circumstance will a grade be changed after the last day of classes.

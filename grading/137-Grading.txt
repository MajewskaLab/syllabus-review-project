Make-up exams will be allowed only in extreme cases and only if there is a well documented absence due to acute illness, jury duty, and other exceptional circumstances that is clearly beyond your control. Exam absences must be documented in advance of the exam day, with the exception of emergencies that can be documented up to 24-hr after the exam time. After proper documentation is submitted, I will determine how to proceed. 
If you submit <1hr late (no points lost), 1-24hr (penalized by 25%), 24-48hr (penalized by 50%), 49-72hr (penalized 75%). You may not submit the in-class EA late without an excused absence.

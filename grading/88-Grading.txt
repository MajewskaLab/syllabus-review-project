As soon as you think there is a possibility you might miss an exam, please contact the instructor for that unit. An unexcused absence from an examination will be recorded as 0. A student with an excused absence from an exam will be retested with special arrangement by the instructor. Per the General Academic Regulations of UGA, the decision to excuse an absence, allow make-up work, or reschedule or make up an exam is entirely at the discretion of each faculty member or instructor.
Grade Dispute:  Students with questions/disputes about quiz, exam or final grades must appeal the issue within one week after posting of the grade. This timeline is much shorter with the final exam – 24 hours – because grades need to be submitted soon after the final.

Missing an exam: Make-up exams will not be given. One of the five exam grades will be dropped, so if unexpected circumstances should arise causing you to miss an exam, you may drop that grade. I do not advise that you plan to drop an exam. Arriving late to an exam: You will have the designated class period to complete your exam, if you arrive late. You will not be allowed to take the exam if you arrive after the first person has turned in the exam. 
Instructor decisions on grades are final, and once posted, grades will not be changed except in cases of clerical error. Please do not ask me to change your grade or give you extra-credit opportunities. Emails requesting grade inflation or extra credit will not receive a response.

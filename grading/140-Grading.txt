All questions about exam grading must be submitted in writing within one week of the return of the exam  anything later than that can be discussed, but no points back will be awarded.  You can anticipate exams will be returned approximately one week after the exam is taken.  Exams will be available prior to class start and those not picked up during the return day(s) can be retrieved from Dr. Dustman, or the course assistants, during their office hours.

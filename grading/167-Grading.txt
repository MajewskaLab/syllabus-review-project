Make-up lecture exams will only be given to students with a legitimate, written excuse. Missed lecture exams without a documented excuse will be recorded as zero scores. 
Due to the time required to set up lab practical exams, make-up exams are virtually impossible and will be considered only for students who contact me before the exam with an extremely serious, documented excuse. Missed lab exams without a documented excuse will be recorded as zero scores.
Your lowest quiz grade will be dropped when calculating your final quiz average. Missed quizzes without a legitimate written excuse will be recorded as a zero. 
Papers turned in after the due date/time will be subject to a 10-point per day deduction. 
No extra credit will be given and final course grades are final! I will strictly adhere to this procedure and breakdown. Be reminded there is no opportunity to have your grade changed (barring a mistake!), to retake tests, or do extra work to improve your grade. You are expected to attend all classes and labs and are responsible for their content. With prior consent or in cases of documented emergencies makeup exams will be considered. Prior consent will be granted in cases of legitimate need. Requests for makeup status are to be made in writing prior to the official exam date.

I am always willing to look at graded exams and adjust scores, if warranted.  However, I will only re-grade exams for up to one week after being returned to the student. 
Rounding will be done to the nearest 0.1%.  For example, if you score an 82.95%, that will be rounded to 83.0% (B).  If you score exactly 82.9%, thatâ€™s a B-.  In the past, I have *not* graded on a curve, as final grades did not warrant it.  Nevertheless, that is always an option should the course average be lower than expected. Do not depend on the presence of a curve in grading!

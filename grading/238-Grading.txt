The best four of those five exam grades will count toward your final grade and the lowest grade will be dropped. No more than one exam will be dropped and no make-up exams will be given.
Make-up exams will not be given. One of the five exam grades will be dropped. If unexpected circumstances should arise causing you to miss an exam, you may drop that grade. I do not advise that you plan to drop any exam. 
Instructor decisions on grades are final, and once posted, grades will not be changed except in cases of clerical error. Please do not ask me to change your grade or give you extra-credit opportunities. Emails requesting grade inflation or extra credit will not receive a response.

Students will be allowed to drop their lowest exam score excluding the final (I will drop the lowest of the first three exams).   The final exam cannot be dropped and students must take the final exam.  If you are absent on a test day (for whatever reason), then the resulting zero will be the one dropped. There will be no make-ups.  
Regular rounding rules apply and will be applied equally to all students.  Any errors in grading should be pointed out asap and students should refrain from making an appointment to search through exams in attempts to increase points.

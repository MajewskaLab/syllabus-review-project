There will be no make-up exams. If you miss an exam for any well-documented legitimate reason, your final exam grade will be applied to your grade for the missed exam. Late assignments will be accepted for full credit only in well-documented emergencies. Hard copies of all assignments must be turned in directly (i.e., in person, NOT mailbox) to the instructor.

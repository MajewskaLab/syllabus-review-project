There will be four exams each worth 25% of your final grade. Your first exam grade will be dropped if it is the lowest of the first three. In this event, I will count the lowest of your second and third exam grades twice in order to replace the low score on the first exam. The final exam will be semi-comprehensive, and you must take it at the scheduled time and date!
There will be no extra credit on any of the exams; however, I will use quizzes for extra credit. Expect the exams to be challenging, and note that I will no longer provide comprehensive study guides. The eLC notes and any notes you take in class will serve as your study guide. You will likely want to avail yourself of whatever extra credit points are made available.

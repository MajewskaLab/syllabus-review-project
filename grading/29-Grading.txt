We will complete six assignments during the semester that will help you learn the 
material and apply what you learn, rather than simply memorizing facts. Although you can work 
with others on these assignments, you are expected to complete and submit your own 
assignments in your own words. The due dates for all assignments will be noted in the unit 
calendars and on each assignment. If you miss the deadline for an assignment, you may submit it 
up to midnight the day before the unit exam with a 30% late penalty. Just be aware that you may 
be foregoing any feedback I could provide on your assignment if you submit it later than the 
original deadline. You will be most successful in this class if you complete all of the assignments, 
and on time.

Reading Circles assignments (role sheets, reflection paper, participation grade) may be made up, but will only be accepted if there is a University accepted excused documentation. Any excused make-up Reading Circles assignments will be due by the next class or at the discretion of the instructor. There will be no make-up exams. Everyone must take the final comprehensive examination. With respect to the final exam, you may use this final exam to replace your lowest exam grade ONLY if you receive a 70 or above on the final. Furthermore, if you have an A in the course before the final, you may exempt the final. This rule applies only if you have an A (not if you are simply satisfied with your grade). Upon receiving a returned assignment, there is a 24 hour policy in which you must wait before coming to talk to me about the grade to allow time for processing the grade

The quizzes will cover the material in the required pre-class preparation and must be completed by 8:30 on the day they are due. No make-ups will be allowed. You will have two attempts at each quiz, although you only need to take the quiz a single time. If you complete two attempts at a quiz, your grade will be calculated as the average of the two attempts. Your two lowest readiness-to-learn grades of the semester will be dropped. All readiness-to-learn quizzes will be listed on the unit calendars. They will occur about once per week.
Your grade on in-class learning assignments will sometimes be based solely on participation, but some activities will also be graded on the basis of accuracy. In-class assignments will be available online and due at midnight the following day. We anticipate you will generally be able to complete them during class time. There will be no make-up in-class learning assignments, regardless of the reason you miss an assignment. Late assignments will not be accepted. We understand that sometimes things happen that will keep you out of class, so your lowest three in-class learning assignment grades will be dropped.

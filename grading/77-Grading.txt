Students may make up a missed Exam (one only) by providing a valid excuse and documentation and taking the Final Exam section corresponding to the Exam missed. The Final Exam score for that section will then replace the missed Exam grade.
Regrades are a courtesy extended by the instructors and should be considered as a privilege, not a right. If you believe there has been a grading error on your exam, you must put in writing the question/answer(s) you wish re-graded and clearly articulate the reason(s) you feel that additional credit should be given. You may give your exam paper and your written statement to the appropriate grader within seven (7) days of when the exam was returned. No grades will be changed after this date. Decisions made by the professor on re-grades are final.

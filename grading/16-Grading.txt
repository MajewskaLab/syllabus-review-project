Assignments are due in class on the days indicated on your syllabus or by your instructor. Each day that an assignment is late, you will lose 10% of the assignment's total point value. Students who have missed four or more labs due to extenuating circumstances with valid documentation and wish to avoid a failing grade should withdraw from the course or request an Incomplete. After the midpoint in the semester, permission to withdraw must be obtained from Linda Edge (542-3564) in the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs. Grade appeal options can be found at You should keep a record of all your lab grades and save your graded papers until the end of the semester. ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT A GRADE MUST BE BROUGHT TO YOUR GLAs ATTENTION, IN WRITTEN FORM WITH A THOROUGH EXPLANATION AS TO WHY YOU DISAGREE WITH THE GRADE, WITHIN ONE WEEK OF THE GRADE BEING POSTED. Under no circumstance will a grade be changed after the last day of classes. The grade of Incomplete (I) is given to students who for reason of accident or illness were unable to complete a segment of the course. In no case will an Incomplete be given as a means of avoiding a failing grade.

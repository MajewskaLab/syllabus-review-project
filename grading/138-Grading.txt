:  Due to amount of participation points and extra credit offered, there is NO CURVE in this class.  Letter grade assignments will be made according to your course percentage on the following scale
There are NO makeup exams – a missed exam will be recorded as a 0 and used as your drop exam.
If you have questions regarding your exam grade, please make an appointment with your instructor within one week of posting of grades.   All questions about exam grading must be submitted as a clearly written or typed hard-copy within one week of your appointment   – late requests can be discussed, but no points back will be returned.  
Extra Credit Opportunities:  Throughout the semester, you will be provided with opportunities to earn extra credit which can earn you up to ~2% of a letter grade that will be added to your total points score.  Extra credit may come in the form or a survey, a pre-test, etc. and will be announced in the News Widget of our eLC course.

Four total examinations will be given in class. Only three of these examinations will be counted toward the final examination grade, which will constitute approximately 85% of the course grade. In other words, each student may drop the lowest examination grade for the semester.
You must be present to receive credit. No make-up assignments will be given under any circumstances. A sufficient number of these assignments will be given during the semester to ensure that missing one assignment for an unexpected absence will not dramatically harm the grade. Multiple absences may, however, result in lowered attendance and participation points. 
Make-up exams will not be given under any circumstances. One examination from the four will be dropped at the end of the semester, so it is advisable not to “plan” a drop examination. Save the drop examination in case of emergency. If no examinations need to be dropped by the final examination session, the final can be exempted.

There will be 12 reading quizzes that you will complete on eLC. Each reading quiz will be worth 10 pts. Only 10 will count toward your grade, which means you can drop/miss two (2) and still earn up to full credit (100 pts). There will be 12 weekly quizzes that you will complete on eLC. Each weekly quiz will be worth 5 points. The weekly quizzes will open at 11:59PM on Thursdays and must be completed by 11:59pm on Friday. You will have a set time limit (TBD) in which you have to start and finish this quiz – probably 15 minutes. Only 10 weekly quizzes will count toward your grade, which means you can miss/drop two (2) and still earn full credit (50 pts). There will be 4 SimBio labs each will be worth 20 points each and all will count, none can be dropped. SimBio labs are the ONLY assignment that will be accepted after the due date, but they will be penalized 20% and no credit will be given after 3 days past the due date. Instructional materials will be posted on eLC throughout the semester and will be the primary way that I will distribute information. I strongly recommend that set your eLC preferences to text you with updates if you don’t check your email on a twice daily (AM and PM) basis.

Late submissions will not receive credit.
There are no make-up quizzes. However, students can miss up to two quizzes for any reason (sickness, travel, transportation issues, job interview, death in the family, etc.) without penalty. In the event that a student completes more than 6 quizzes, only the top 6 quiz scores will count for the final grade calculation.
In the event that a student completes all three exams, the lowest score of the first three exams will be dropped. The final exam is mandatory, and students may not drop the score on the final exam. The final exam is not comprehensive, and will only cover material presented after the 3rd exam. Makeup exams will not be allowed for any exam. 
Any grading dispute must be addressed within one week from the date that the relevant exam grade is posted on eLC.

If you miss an exam or due date, you must have a valid excuse (to be determined at my discretion; e.g., excused by a medical or psychological professional, excused by student affairs committee). Contact me ASAP in this situation.
If you foresee a scheduling conflict with the exam schedule and the conflict is reasonable based on my discretion (e.g., jury duty, more than two exams that day), let me know at least 2 weeks prior to the exam day to arrange another day to take the exam. Failure to do so will result in a zero for that exam.
No in-class assignments or activities (for participation credit or extra credit) can be “made up” or replaced with an alternate assignment. There will be in-class activities that are not mentioned on the syllabus. You must be in class to receive credit. 
All assignments must be physically turned in by the end of class for credit. Late assignments will not be accepted.

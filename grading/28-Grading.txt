There will be at least twelve graded ITNs but only the top eleven will count towards your final grade. Points are awarded based on a percentage of correctly completed questions in each assignment. There is not necessarily a one-to-one point correspondence. There will be five-unit exams but only the top four individual exams scores will count towards your final grade. There will be four group exams but only the top three scores will count towards your final grade. Late assignments will receive a zero. All grades will be posted on the course eLC website. At the end of the semester if the classâ€™s average score falls below 75% we will adjust grades so that the average is no lower than a letter grade of C.

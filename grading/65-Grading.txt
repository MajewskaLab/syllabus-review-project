This course is graded on a generous curve. Therefore, your final course grade is determined based 
on the final distribution of all grades in the class, not on any specific grade cut-off. For example, 
getting above an 89.45 average does not guarantee an ‘A-’ grade. We assign plus-minus grades 
using the following guidelines: ‘A:’ achievement that is outstanding and well above the level 
necessary to meet course requirements; ‘B:’ achievement that is above the level necessary to meet 
course requirements; ‘C:’ achievement that meets the basic course requirements; ‘D:’ achievement 
that is worthy of credit even though it does not fully meet the basic course requirements; ‘F:’ 
achievement that fails to satisfy the basic course requirements. The final grade distribution in last 
year’s class, including +’s and –‘s, was: ‘A:’ 16%; ‘B:’ 47%; ‘C:’ 32%; ‘D:’ 4%; ‘F:’ 1%. Students who 
scored the class average received a C+. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future 
results and the distribution of grades this semester may be different from past years

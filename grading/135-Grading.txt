Final scores will not be rounded (i.e., 89.99% is a B+ and 90.01% is an A-).
Your grade will be based on your performance relative to the mean total score of the three highest undergraduate scores in the class.
Special Treatment: Please do not request individual special treatment regarding grading at the end of the semester; we do not adjust grades for individuals, even if you are within 0.01 points of a grade cutoff (B+/A-). We do this to keep things as fair as possible across all students. Plan to do well on all exams and other assessments from the beginning of the semester. If you have ongoing challenges with the material or stemming from health issues, please see the instructor as soon as possible, so that we can help you.
Late submissions: Late assignments will not be accepted without justification (e.g. serious and documented illness). 
Regrades: If you feel that we have graded your exam incorrectly, you may submit a written request for a regrade. Deadlines for requests are 1 week after we return exams. Your request must be submitted 1) to one of the instructors (not your TA); 2) with a typed cover letter detailing why you think you should receive additional credit. Your entire exam will be regraded.

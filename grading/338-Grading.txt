If a student wishes to have an exam re-graded, she/he must submit in writing the nature of the problem, and the exam, no later than one week after the exam has been returned. The entire exam will be rechecked. 
No make-up exams or quizzes will be given unless official UGA excuse is given (i.e., medical leave, etc.).

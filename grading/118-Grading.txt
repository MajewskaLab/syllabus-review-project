Over the semester, you will accumulate points through participation in breakout sessions, in-class activities, and four written exams. The total number of accumulated points will be used to determine your grade. If the point average is below 390 (83%), the instructors may adjust the average final GPA of the class up to 2.9 ("curving"). 
Should a medical emergency or other pressing obligation prevent you from participating in one of the exams, you will have the opportunity of completing a makeup exam. In case of pressing obligations, such as a scientific meeting, a UGA-sponsored field trip, or an interview at a professional / graduate school, please make sure you obtain written consent by the instructor in advance of the exam you want to miss (email is fine). In case of medical emergencies, please provide the instructor with written documentation by the physician's office or a qualified health care professional.

Students who are unable to complete assignments or exams must present a doctor’s note to reschedule these items. Note, all lecture material will be available on eLC to all students, so only the assessments will need to be rescheduled. Furthermore, please note that it is preferred to request the absence before the exam or homework is due, if at all possible.
Homework will be given on eLC, combined these will count for 20% of your final grade. Please complete the homework earlier than the due date. Exceptions will not be given for unforeseen events that occur late Monday night and prevent completion of the assignment.
The final exam is optional.  If taken, the final will count for 20% of final grade, and will replace the hourly exam with lowest score, even if the score on the final exam is lower than the in-class exam.  
Extra credit (0.5% of your final grade) is available by completing the course survey before the final exam. Access to the survey will be provided near the end of the semester.
Grades on each exam and quiz will be “curved” upwards so that the average score is at least a 75.

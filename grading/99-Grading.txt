Makeup exams will only be given in the case of a documented medical or extreme personal emergency. It is the student’s responsibility to provide relevant and detailed documentation. Contact one of the instructor’s as soon as possible if you will miss an exam. An unexcused missed exam will count 0 points.
Regrades: All regrade requests must be submitted via Outbox (link will be provided on eLC after first exam) within one week of the exam being returned. Teaching assistants do not handle regrade requests. Submission of a regrade request will result in the entire exam being regarded. If you notice an error in the addition of points on your exam, simply notify the instructor after class or by email so that it can be corrected.

To request a re-grade, you should email me (bedell@uga.edu) within 48 hours of the exam scores being released. With your request, you should give a brief explanation of the reason for the request (e.g. points were not totaled correctly, and why you think your answer(s) should be considered correct). At my discretion, the entire exam, not just the requested question(s), may be re-graded. 
If you miss a regular exam for other reasons, such as illness, death in the immediate family, or car accidents, you may request an excused absence. To obtain an excused absence, you must provide written documentation for your absence to me by the Monday following the exam. If you obtain an excused absence for an exam, your course total will be adjusted accordingly (see below for details).
If you miss an exam but do not receive an excused absence, you will receive a score of zero for that exam. There will be no make-up exams.

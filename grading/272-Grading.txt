There are no make-up quizzes, so if you miss a quiz, that is counted as a zero. However, you can drop your lowest quiz grade, thus the remaining quiz scores will count for the 20% of your grade. 
If you miss an exam (unexcused), that is scored as a zero. Make-up exams for excused absences must be arranged with Dr. Karls well in advance for University-approved absences or the day of return from an illness (Doctorâ€™s excuse is required for full period of absence). 
Re-grading must be requested in writing with an explanation of the reason that re-grading is needed. You have 7 days after the exam is returned to the class to request a re-grade (turn in your request to the TA).

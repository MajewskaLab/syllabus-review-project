Exams must be taken as scheduled. Exams can be rescheduled or made-up only under extreme circumstances and if the student provides appropriate documentation of an emergency. Make-up exams must be completed within 1 week of the regularly scheduled exam. If the student is aware ahead of time that he/she will be unable to take the exam at the regularly scheduled time due to a university-sanctioned activity, religious holiday, etc., he/she must inform the instructor of the conflict as soon as it arises, and not afterward. If the absence is an emergency, as in the case of extreme illness or some other extenuating circumstance, the student must inform the instructor immediately and provide documentation of the emergency. Unexcused absences from exams will result in a grade of zero (0%) for the missed exam.

Once graded and posted to eLC, you will be able to review an exam during my office hours. However, you have two weeks following the posting of the grades, and review must be done in my office during office hours. This two-week window will be your only opportunity to review a particular exam. If you have not reviewed an exam during this time, you will not be able to go over it later to prepare for the final, nor will you be able to appeal or contest the grade. Please see the Grade Appeals section of this syllabus for details.
Final letter grades might be changed based upon factual errors. No other criteria are acceptable. Please note that if there is a factual error in a score you see recorded on eLearning Commons, you have one week after that score is posted to have that error corrected.

There are no artificial quotas established for grades in ECOL3505/L.  In fact, it is my assumption and most fond wish that everyone will earn an A in this course.  Apply yourself to participation in class and learning the material, and you should earn that A for your effort.  Take your laboratory seriously; it is worth a third of your grade.  Develop a positive, professional relationship with your laboratory instructor, for he/she will determine your laboratory grade.  Before final grades are submitted, I provide my TAs with the opportunity to petition for a borderline student to be bumped to a higher grade, if they are convinced that one of their students has committed fully to the laboratory experience and deserves recognition for that fact.

You are responsible for competing all exams, quizzes, and assignments by the due date/time.  If you have a problem (internet connection, etc.), please contact one or both of the professors ASAP, and we will do our best to accommodate.  Assignments turned in past the due date will lose points.  Online exams and quizzes will lock when the time limit is reached and/or when they are due, and you will not be able to continue working on them after that point.
If you know you will miss a class or deadline because of a time conflict (doctor appointment, etc.), please contact one or both of your instructors in advance or ASAP.  If we don’t hear from you before an exam (or within a reasonable time of the exam if you have an unexpected issue), we won’t be able to grant a make-up.

All exams are graded anonymously by the TAs and the instructor. We try to grade as quickly and fairly as possible. However, if you believe that a question was graded incorrectly and want it regraded, please submit a typed and signed request to the professor within 1 week of receiving the graded exam. Requests must include a detailed explanation of why you think your response is scientifically accurate. Regrade requests that are not legitimate (e.g., lack an explanation or are incorrect) will result in the loss of a point. No exams completed in pencil will be regraded. The professor will regrade the question. If a math error was made in calculating your grades, please notify a TA of the mistake during class or a breakout session and they will fix it. In other words, there is no need to submit a regrade request for a math error.

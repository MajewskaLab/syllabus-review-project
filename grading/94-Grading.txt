If you believe there has been grading error on your exam, questions about grading must be submitted in writing within one week of the return of the exam. Late assignments will lose 10% of the assignment value for every day late. This means that if you turn in an assignment at any time within 24 hours after the assignment is due it will lose 10% of the possible point value.

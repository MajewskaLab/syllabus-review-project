Absences from exams or other graded work must be arranged in advance and only for serious reasons. Re-writes for an un-notified absence from an exam will only be considered when there is an extreme and documented emergency and will be dealt with on a case by case basis. It is generally not possible to make up labs because of the prep time and because several labs are field trips that cannot be repeated. Late assignments will be penalized 10% per day and after one week will not be accepted (i.e., assigned a grade of zero).

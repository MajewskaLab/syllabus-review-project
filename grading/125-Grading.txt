Make-up exams will be offered	only in cases of serious medical or other personal emergencies that prevent a student from taking the regularly scheduled exam. Any student who finds him/herself in this situation should contact Dr. Hopkinson before the regularly scheduled exam if at all possible, and in any case not more than 24 h after the exam. Documentation from a health care provider (in the case of illness), or other sources as appropriate, will be required. The decision to offer a make-up exam is at the sole discretion of the course Professor.
No make-ups will be available for in-class projects or exercises.

Exam scores cannot be dropped. 
Makeup exams will only be given in the case of a documented medical or extreme personal emergency. It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to provide relevant and detailed documentation. Contact Dr. Dyer as soon as possible if you will miss an exam. In most cases, contacting an instructor after the exam has started is too late to be allowed to take a makeup exam. An unexcused missed exam will count as 0 points.
All regrade requests must be submitted via Outbox (link will be provided on eLC after first exam) within one week of the exam being returned. Teaching assistants do not handle regrade requests. Submission of a regrade request will result in the entire exam being regraded. If you notice an error in the addition of points on your exam, simply notify the instructor by email so that it can be corrected.

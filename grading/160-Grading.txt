If you feel your exam has a grading error, you must contact your TA or the TA who graded the question. You have one week from the time the exams are handed back to contest the grading in writing.  After the one-week period, we will be glad to discuss the exam, but no changes to your grade will be made. 
Make-up Exam Policy: Make-up exams for the lab midterm and lab final practical exams will only be given when a student cannot attend any of the lab sections to take the exam at the scheduled time and has a written excuse for this absence.  The make-up exam will be different from the one given at the scheduled time and may be an oral or an essay exam and will include any material previous covered in class, without regard to particular study guides that may have been given by TAs. Mr. Samuels must be contacted by the Friday following the scheduled exam to request a make-up lab practical.  After this time, no make-up exams will be given and you will receive a zero for that exam. 
No make up Thursday lab lecture quizzes will be given.  If you know you will miss a quiz due to an excusable absence, contact Mr. Samuels at least 24 hrs in advance to make an appointment to take the quiz early.

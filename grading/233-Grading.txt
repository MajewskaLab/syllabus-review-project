Grades will not be rounded up and there will be no extra credit opportunities for individual students. Do not wait until the end of the semester to get help if your grade is not where you want it to be or you are struggling with the course material. Please come see me immediately so that we can deal with any issues before it is too late to improve
You have one week from receiving a grade on an exam or assignment to challenge that grade (unless there is a mathematical/clerical error which you can document). After one week, I will not discuss grade changes on past assignments. If you would like to meet with me about a graded assignment/project, you must write a brief summary which includes the following: one paragraph summarizing the assignment instructions and a second paragraph explaining why your assignment met the criteria. This written summary must be submitted to me 24 hours prior to our scheduled appointment to discuss your grade. Additionally, if you ask me to review your assignment, you should be prepared for the possibility that your grade may decrease if I find additional errors/issues that I missed the first time around. 
Missed Exams: Exams cannot be made up under any circumstances. One examination from the four will be dropped at the end of the semester, so it is advisable not to “plan” a drop examination. Save the drop examination in case of emergency. If no examinations need to be dropped by the final examination session, the final can be exempted.

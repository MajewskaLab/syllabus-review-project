Laboratory attendance is mandatory, and students must arrive on time. Assignments will accompany lab activities. Unless otherwise specified, homework assignments will be due by 5pm one week following the distribution of the assignment. All lab assignments will be submitted electronically via eLC. Late assignments will be penalized 10% per week day. For weeks where a discussion is indicated as the lab activity, students should come to the discussion section with a short (1/2 page SS) summary of the assigned reading.

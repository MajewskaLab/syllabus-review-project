Grading (grades from A to F) will be based on your attendance and performance in the lab, quality of research proposal and work on written assignments, quality of recording and analysis of experimental results, and quality of presentation of your findings in a poster. Failure to submit assignments on time, and non-excused absence or tardiness will result in final grade reductions.

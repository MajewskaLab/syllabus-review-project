Late Assignments: Homework will be accepted up to 24 hours after the due date for a 50% penalty. For example, if you earn 6/7 on an assignment submitted 5 minutes late, your score will be 3/7. After 24 hours after the due date, assignments will not be accepted.
• Make-up Exams: Special arrangements must be made in advance by email, if a universityapproved absence will prevent you from taking one of the exams during the scheduled date and time.

Final letter grades are changed based upon factual errors. No other criteria are acceptable. Please note that if there is a factual error in the score you see recorded on eLearning Commons, you have one week after that score is posted to have that error corrected.
If you miss a deadline, you will receive a zero on that assignment. There are no extensions under any circumstances.

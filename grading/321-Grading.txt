If you miss an exam (unexcused), that is scored as a zero.  Make-up exams for excused absences must be arranged with the professor giving the exam (see syllabus) well in advance for University-approved absences or the day of return from an illness (Doctorâ€™s excuse is required for full period of absence).   Exams may have a mix of short answer, discussion, multiple choice, and fill-in tables.  You must use a pen to take the exams or you cannot request a re-grade. Re-grading must be requested in writing with an explanation of the reason that re-grading is needed within 7 days after the exam is returned to the class.

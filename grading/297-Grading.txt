Late Policy: Late assignments will be penalized 5% per day of the total available points. We will not accept late response papers or final papers (grant proposals). A paper will be considered “on time” if we receive an uncorrupted electronic version submitted on or before the deadline.

Make-up exams: There will be no makeup exams. Athletes and students who have an excused absence during the time of an exam need to arrange to take the exam in advance. If you fall ill before the exam, contact us as soon as possible and bring a doctor’s note explaining that you were unable to take the exam. In the case of an excused illness, we will arrange an alternative time for the exam.

If you miss an exam (unexcused), it will be scored as a zero. Make-up exams for excused absences must be arranged with the professor giving the exam (see syllabus) well in advance for University-approved absences or the day of return from an illness (Doctorâ€™s excuse is required for full period of absence). Exams may have a mix of short answer, short discussion, multiple choice, and fill-in the blanks. You must use a pen to answer the exams or you cannot request a re-grade. There will be no individual extra credit to improve grades.

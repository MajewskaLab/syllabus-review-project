There are NO make-up exams/quizzes...NO exceptions. If you miss an exam/quiz due to an excused absence you will need to meet with Dr. Neidle or Dr. Hoover to arrange how your missing exam/quiz grade will be handled. If you miss an exam without an approved excuse, then you will receive a grade of zero for the exam/quiz. You must use a pen to take the exams/quizzes or you cannot request a re-grade. Re-grading must be requested in writing with an explanation of the reason that re-grading is needed. You have 7 days after the exam is returned to the class to request a re-grade (turn in your request the TA).

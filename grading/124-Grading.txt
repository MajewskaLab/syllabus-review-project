The lowest 3 exercise grades, excluding the presentation, will be dropped from the grade calculation. No make-ups will be available for in-class exercises. Make-up exams will only be offered in cases of serious medical or personal circumstances that prevent a student from taking the regularly scheduled exam. Any student who finds him/herself in this situation should contact Dr. Binder before the regularly scheduled exam if at all possible, and in any case not more than 24 h after the exam. Documentation from a health care provider (in the case of illness), or other sources as appropriate, will be required. The decision to offer a make-up exam is at the sole discretion of Dr. Binder. No make-ups will be available for in-class exercises. No extra credit is available for this course.

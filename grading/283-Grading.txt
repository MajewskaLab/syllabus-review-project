Homework may be submitted late, but 3 points per 24 hour period will be deducted from the point value.  No points will be deducted for 48 hours if you have a documented medical issue.
If a documented long-term medical issue prevents you from completing assignments, make-up assignments will be provided after November 1.  It is your responsibility to request make-up assignments.

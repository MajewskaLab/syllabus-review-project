Grades will be assigned on a scale of A-F, depending on scores on a comparative basis across the class. As a rough guide, the class average will be set as the lowest B-. If the class average should be above 80, individuals scoring 90-100 are guaranteed an A, those scoring 80-90 are guaranteed a B or better, and those scoring 70-80 are guaranteed a C or better (See the chart below).  Beginning Summer Semester, 2006, the University adopted +/- grading.  A grade of C (2.0) is considered passing.  For the purposes of the HOPE scholarship, GPA will still be computed according to the old (A, B, C, D, F) grading scale.

Asynchronous lectures on eLC MUST be completed by 11:59pm on the date corresponding to the specific lecture topic (as listed above). Students who view a lecture after the due date listed on eLC will not receive participation credit for that lecture; credit is determined according to the eLC timestamp for lecture completion. Asynchronous lectures will be posted on eLC one week prior to the due date. Full participation credit will be awarded to students with 80% or more of the total possible participation points over the course of the semester. Below this 80% threshold, the credit awarded will equal the % credit earned.
Make-up exams will be offered only in the cases of serious medical or other personal emergencies that prevent a student from taking the regularly scheduled exam. Any student who finds themselves in this situation should contact the Dr. Bik and Dr. Saunders before the regularly scheduled exam if at all possible, and in any case not more than 24 hours after the exam. Documentation from a health care provider (in the case of illness), or other sources as appropriate, will be required. The decision to offer a make-up exam is at the sole discretion of the course instructor

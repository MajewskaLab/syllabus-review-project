After the first person has completed the exam, I will still hand out exams to those who arrive past that point, but the exam can only be completed for 75% of the total points. Arrive on time!

It is your responsibility to contact me if you miss an exam. Make-up exams will only occur with validated excuses (i.e.. Doctorâ€™s note, athletic form, etc.).

There will be NO make-ups for missed quizzes. For students who have missed quizzes because of their participation in official and pre-approved UGA-sponsored activities, the final exam score will count as the score for the missed quiz. For students with documented emergencies (from hospitals, police departments, courts, funeral homes …etc.), I may forward the documents to UGA officials for inspection and verification.  In case your documented emergency is verified and approved, your final quiz grade will replace the “0” received as a score for the missed quiz.

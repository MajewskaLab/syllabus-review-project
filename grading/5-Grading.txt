All assessment quizzes are designed so that you access the course readings or online resources to answer the questions. You just have to answer them yourselves without using the "phone a friend" option. In addition to the quizzes and discussion posts, all written work is individual work, and it would be considered a violation of The University of Georgia's Academic Honesty policy to use unauthorized assistance or to plagiarize work. Late work will be accepted with a 10% deduction of total points for each day it is late.

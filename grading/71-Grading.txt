Make-up exams will come from an exam bank and may not reflect the material emphasized in lecture. A WRITTEN EXCUSE is REQUIRED for all make-up exams. In the case of severe illness or family emergency, you must inform the instructor prior to the exam. In addition, presentation of a signed letter from your doctor, etc., will be required. An unexcused absence will result in a grade of zero. An absence will be counted as unexcused if the instructor is not notified before the exam is given. If you believe there has been grading error on your exam, questions about grading must be submitted in writing within one week of the return of the exam.

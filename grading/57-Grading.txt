There will be NO make-ups for missed quizzes.  Documented emergencies (from hospitals, police departments, courts, funeral homes …etc.) are submitted to me.  I may forward the documents to Students’ Dean Office for inspection and verification.  In case your documented emergency is verified and approved by the Dean’s office, your Final Exam score will replace the “0” received as a score for the missed quiz.

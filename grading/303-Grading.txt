Accommodations for make-up (or early) examinations will be made in the case of planned and excused absences.  The mechanism for make-up examinations (e.g. whether the same or different testing is used) will be determined on a case-by-case basis.  
Whether or not make-up exams will be made available for unplanned absences, and how missing exam grades would figure into the final grade, will be decided on a case-by-case basis.  If you miss an exam it is imperative that you follow these guidelines: (1) Do not talk to anyone in the class about the exam.  (2) Contact me as soon as possible.  (3) Be prepared to take a make-up exam as soon as possible, which may include evening or weekend times.

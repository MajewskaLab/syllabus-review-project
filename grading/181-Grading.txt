Make-ups for exams will only be offered in cases of serious medical or personal circumstances that prevent a student from taking the exam at the regularly-scheduled time.  Any student who finds him/herself in this situation should contact the instructor before the exam period, if at all possible. The decision to offer a make-up exam is at the discretion of the instructor.
No make-ups will be available for in-class, lab, or field exercises. 
No extra credit is available for this course.

Late Reading Quizzes will NOT be accepted.
edit
• Case studies will be accepted for 4 days after the due date but 1 point will
be deducted for every day you are late.
• You should turn in your cases to the eLC assignment drop box. Only
Word files (.doc or docx) are allowed for submission.
• 6 questions of each case studies will be selected randomly and graded
using a grading rubric, worth 1.5 points each:
1.5 point: question correct
1.0 points: question partially correct
0.75 point: question incorrect but attempted
0 points: question not answered
• There is NO MAKE-UP for any missed Top Hat Question, Reading quiz,
case, or exam.
• If you must miss an exam for a university-sanctioned event (e.g., an
athletic competition) or a graduate/professional school interview, you may
arrange an early exam. You must provide written documentation of the
event to the professor at least one week prior to the date when you would
like to take the exam.
• Appeals for Top Hat participations and Top Hat Questions must be
verbally made to me just after class (that is, the day of).
• Grade appeals (except Top Hat grade) must be submitted to me in
writing within two weeks of receiving the grade.
• To be excused from class, students must submit the document
proving the situation.
In order to be fair, there are no exceptions to these policies.

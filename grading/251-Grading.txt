This course has two exams, evenly spaced through the semester. The scoring scheme for each exam is printed on the exam, detailing the points available. Following each exam, they will be graded, scanned and returned to students, and an answer key will be posted on eLC. After reviewing the exam and answer key carefully, if a student believes an exam has been graded incorrectly, they should note in writing: the question(s) concerned, the nature of the perceived grading error and documentation from class materials (lecture slides, readings) supporting the claim. Student appeals, in the form of these detailed notes, must be submitted by hard copy or by email to an instructor of record for the course within 7 days of the exams being returned. Following this appeal, the studentâ€™s entire exam will be regraded. Please note, if further grading errors are found, these will be corrected, meaning that the exam grade could be higher or lower than the original reported grade.

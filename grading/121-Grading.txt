This course is not necessarily graded on a curve. Therefore, if every student produced excellent results, every student could get an "A". The guaranteed score to achieve a grade will be as follows: 90% - A, 80-89% - B, 70-79% - C, 60-69% - D. The instructors reserve the right at the end of the course to lower the grade boundaries.

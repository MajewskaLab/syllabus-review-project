You should keep a record of your grades and save your graded assignments until the end of the term. If you have a concern about a grade, you must bring it to my attention, via a written explanation as to why you disagree with the grade, within 3 calendar days of the grade being posted to eLC. Final grades will be rounded to the nearest whole number (e.g., 89.49 rounds down to 89; 89.50 rounds up to 90). 
All written assignments should be submitted electronically to the corresponding eLC Dropbox by the due date indicated on eLC. After the due date, late assignments will incur a 10% penalty per day. Five (5) days after the due date, unsubmitted assignments will receive a grade of zero and will not be accepted.
If you have an unavoidable circumstance that prevents you from turning in an assignment on time, please contact me before the due date to see if an extension or alternate due date may be possible. If you have an emergency that causes you to miss a due date, please contact me as soon as possible after the due date to arrange for a late submission waiver.

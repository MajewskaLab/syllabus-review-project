Students are responsible for all material and handouts covered in lecture, and in the laboratory.  There will be three lecture midterm examinations (100 points each); each professor will set the exam that covers their portion of the course.  Midterm examinations will be a combination of multiple choice/fill in the blank and written answer (generally 1-2 paragraphs). Each midterm will emphasize material covered in class or assigned readings since the previous exam, but questions addressing comparisons with material from earlier in the course may be asked.  From time to time, readings may be assigned over the semester, and students will be given sample questions to consider regarding the readings.  These assignments will not be graded directly, but material from the assigned readings may be included in the midterm and final examinations.

The lecture final examination will be a comprehensive exam covering the whole semester.  This exam will be optional: students will have the option of keeping their end-of-semester grade, or they may elect to drop their lowest midterm and take the final exam.  The final exam will be structured similarly to the midterms.  Note that the final exam is worth 200 points, so it is worth more than the dropped midterm.  Be aware that this can affect calculation of your final grade.  As we get to the end of the semester Dr. Champagne will post material to help guide you in calculating the grade you will need to earn on the final exam to raise your final letter grade.  The decision whether or not to take the final is up to you.

Examinations can be made up only if the instructor is notified in advance, and receives proof in writing of a legitimate reason (as per University policy) to miss the original exam.  Makeup exams will differ from the original exams, and may be more demanding.

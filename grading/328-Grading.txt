If you miss an in-class team-based project, you will not be able to make up that score, regardless of your excuse. If you miss a lecture quiz, you will be able to reschedule that quiz if you (1) contact me within 24 hours of the quiz date and (2) provide a valid excuse. You must take this quiz before the next scheduled class period

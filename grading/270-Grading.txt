A missed exam is scored as a zero unless you have a medical excuse from a doctor that says you could not attend class or an official excuse to attend a University-sanctioned activity. You must have an acceptable excuse for every day you do not take the makeup exam
If there is a problem with the grading of your exam, you must submit the exam to Dr. Karls or Dr. Szymanski for consideration within 7 days after the exam is returned to the class; please provide a description of the problem in writing, such as “points were added incorrectly”, etc.
Acceptance of late assignments is at the discretion of the instructor and, if the assignment is accepted, the grade will be reduced by 10% for each day that it is late.

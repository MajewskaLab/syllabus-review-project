Missed discussion board posts and quizzes: We have designed the course to minimize the impact of missing quizzes and discussion board posts. You can miss one of each and still earn full credit in the course. You can also choose to take an optional final exam to replace your three lowest post case quiz scores. If you are going to miss a quiz or discussion board post due to illness, authorized representation of the University, or extraordinary personal circumstances, please notify the instructors as soon as possible so we can figure out a reasonable way for you to make up the work and stay up-to-speed on class material. Unexcused late submissions wonâ€™t be accepted and will result in a score of zero (0) for that quiz or post.isgraded

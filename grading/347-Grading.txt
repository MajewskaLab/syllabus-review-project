Unexcused absences are not eligible for make-up activities. As a result, you will earn 0 points for the in-class or homework assignment associated with the lab you missed. You also will not earn participation points for that lab. If you have a question or complaint about a grade on an assignment or quiz, you must bring it to your TAâ€™s attention by submitting a grade dispute form, which includes a written explanation as to why you disagree with the grade, within 5 calendar days of the grade being posted to eLC. Due dates for all graded activities are listed on eLC; quizzes and assignments must be submitted through eLC by the due date. Late submissions will incur a 10% per day penalty after the due date. Assignments and quizzes will not be accepted for credit more than 7 calendar days after the due date and will receive a grade of zero.

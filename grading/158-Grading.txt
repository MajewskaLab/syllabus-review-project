Regrade requests will be allowed for all assignments, and you are encouraged to look over your grades for each assignment as it is returned. If you feel you have a grading error, you have one week from the time the assignment is handed back to contest the grading. All re-grade requests must be made in writing (typed in an e-mail). You must clearly state why you think you deserve credit for your answer. Regrade requests for post-lab assignments, project reports, and practical exams should be submitted to your lab TA. Regrade requests for pre-lab assignments should be addressed to the lecture TA, Yang Su. If there are additional concerns after the re-grade from the TA, you may submit in writing to Dr. Grainy AND Dr. Ottesen your concern. They will re-grade the assignment/exam and the grade will be final. Lecture exam re-grade requests should be sent directly to Dr. Grainy AND Dr. Ottesen for us to evaluate.
If you are unable to attend an exam due to illness or other unforeseen circumstance, you must contact both Dr. Grainy and your TA as soon as you know you are unable to attend and no later than 1 hour prior to exam time. It is your responsibility to arrange a makeup exam time with your TA (practical exams) or Dr. Grainy (lecture exams). All documentation of absence must be submitted and a makeup time arranged within 24 hours of your absence. After this time, no make-up exams will be given and you will receive a zero for that exam.

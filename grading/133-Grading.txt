Please do not request individual special treatment regarding grading at the end of the semester; we will not adjust grades for individuals, even if you are within 0.01 points of a grade cutoff (B+/A-). We do this to keep things as fair as possible across all students. Plan to do well on all exams and other assessments from the beginning of the semester. If you have ongoing challenges with the material or stemming from health issues, please see one of the instructors as soon as possible, so that we can help you.
Late submissions: Submissions received < 1 hr late will be penalized by 5%. Quizzes received between 1 and 24 hrs late will be penalized by 25%. Quizzes received between 24 – 48 hrs late will be penalized by 50%. Quizzes received between 48 – 72 hrs late will be penalized by 75%. No submissions will be accepted after 72 hrs past the deadline. 
Make-up exams will be allowed only in extreme cases and only if there is a well-documented absence due to acute illness, jury duty, and other exceptional circumstances that is clearly beyond your control. Exam absences must be documented in advance of the exam day, with the exception of emergencies that can be documented up to 24-hr after the exam time. After proper documentation is submitted, the instructor will determine how to proceed.

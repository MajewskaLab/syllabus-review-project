*If you are aware that you will be absent on an exam day, you must notify my ONE WEEK in advance, and we will arrange for you to take the exam on a different date. If you miss an exam due to an illness or emergency, I will need documentation such as a doctor's note, copy of a speeding ticket, search warrant (kidding!), etc.

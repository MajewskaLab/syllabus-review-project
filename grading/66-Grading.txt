This course is graded on a generous curve. Therefore, your final course grade is determined based on the final distribution of all grades in the class, not on any specific grade cut-off. For example, getting above an 89.45 average does not guarantee an ‘A-’ grade. We assign plus-minus grades using the following guidelines:  ‘A:’ achievement that is outstanding and well above the level necessary to meet course requirements; ‘B:’ achievement that is above the level necessary to meet course requirements; ‘C:’ achievement that meets the basic course requirements; ‘D:’ achievement that is worthy of credit even though it does not fully meet the basic course requirements; ‘F:’ achievement that fails to satisfy the basic course requirements. The final grade distribution in the Fall 2010 class, including +’s and –‘s, was: A: 23%; B: 42%; C: 28%; D: 4%; F: 3%. Students who scored the class average received a B-.  Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results and the distribution of grades this semester may be different from past years.

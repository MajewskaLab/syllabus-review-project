Late submission of quizzes will result in a score of zero (0) for that quiz. If you miss an exam or quiz due to illness, authorized representation of the University, or extraordinary personal circumstances, you must notify your current instructor and provide documentation for your absence as soon as possible. There are no make-up Unit Exams in this class. Those with an excused absence for a Unit Exam will be offered the cumulative final exam to be taken during finals week.
Regrade requests: Regrade requests must be made by Email or in person no later than one-week after
the exam date. Your request must include a valid explanation for why your answer was misgraded

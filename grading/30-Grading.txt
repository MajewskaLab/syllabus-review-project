Missed Assignments - If you miss an assignment due to illness, authorized representation of the 
University, or extraordinary personal circumstances, you must notify me as soon as possible. For 
excused absences from an exam, make-up exams generally will not be given; rather the score on a 
missed exam will be your drop. Unexcused absences will receive a score of zero.
More generally, requests for extensions on any assignment due to illness, authorized representation 
of the University, or extraordinary personal circumstances must be requested in advance of the 
deadline or as soon as possible. Unexcused late submissions of assignments are not acceptable and 
will result in a score of zero (0) being entered for that assignment.
Appeals Process - If you feel that there has been a mistake in your grade on an exam or another 
assignment you need to submit a written regrade request through eLC mail within one week of 
the work being returned to you. The request should be detailed and written in a professional 
manner. Keep in mind that regrading could potentially lead to a lower rather than a higher final 
grade so be quite certain before you make this request. For questions about scantron issues or to 
see a copy of your exam please contact Ms. Mikiesha Hill, 403A Biol. Sci. Bldg.; mikiesha@uga.edu;

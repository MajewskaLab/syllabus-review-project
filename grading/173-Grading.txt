Students can miss any one of the first three exams for any reason (sickness, travel, transportation issues, death in the family, etc.) without any penalty. In the event that a student completes all three exams, the lowest score of the first 3 exams will be dropped. The final exam is mandatory, and students may not drop the score on the final exam. Make-up exams will not be allowed for any exam except in the rare instance where a student experiences very serious personal illness or immediate family emergency on the date of the exam and who meet all of the following requirements: 1) Student must notify the instructor of the reason for their absence prior to the exam, 2) Student must provide official documentation of serious personal illness or immediate family emergency within 2 days of the exam date, and 3) If the documentation is confirmed, the make-up exam will be taken at the earliest possible date following the scheduled exam. The exam will not be identical to the class exam, and may be essay based.
Students can schedule (through email) a virtual office visit to review their answers and scores on past exams. Any grading dispute must be addressed within one week from the date that the relevant exam grade is posted on eLC.

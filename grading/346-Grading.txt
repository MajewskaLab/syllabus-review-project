All late work will be graded as a zero, unless F.Scott has approved makeup work. Students who have a legitimate reason for missing coursework should notify F.Scott immediately to discuss makeup work. Students who arrive to class late on an Exam Day (after another student has seen/taken the exam and left the room) will have their exam considered late (ie. grade of zero). (Documentation of reason for absence will be requested for approval of makeup  coursework).

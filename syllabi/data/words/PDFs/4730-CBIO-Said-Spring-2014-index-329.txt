quizzes because of their participation in official and pre-approved UGA-sponsored activities, the final exam score
will count as the score for the missed quiz. For students with documented emergencies (from hospitals, police departments, courts, funeral homes ...etc.), I may forward the documents to UGA officials for inspection and verification. In case your documented emergency is verified and approved, your final quiz grade will replace the "0" received as a score for the missed quiz. Final quiz is administered during the official Final Exam day, Tuesday, May 6th (7:00-10:00PM).

Extra credit assignments: - There will be NO extra credit assignments.

the Office of Student Affairs. Any student convicted of academic dishonesty will receive a grade of "F". Final letter

grade is assigned as follows:

88.00 - 89.99 = A-

86.00 - 87.99 = B+

80.00 - 85.99 = B

78.00 - 79.99 = B-

If you choose to engage in a conduct that is disruptive to other students, you will be asked to immediately leave the classroom for the remainder of the class period. Repeated improper conduct will result in you facing an administrative withdrawal from class.

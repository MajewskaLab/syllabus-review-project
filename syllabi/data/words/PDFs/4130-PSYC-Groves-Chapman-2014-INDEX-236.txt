Course Description: The biological bases of human and nonhuman behavior, with emphasis on underlying physiological mechanisms, and on the development, evolution, and function of behavior.

Objectives: By the end of the course students should have learned:
 Some of the historical, philosophical, and methodological issues associated with behavioral neuroscience
 Some of the methods used in the study of behavioral neuroscience  Some of the fundamentals of neuroscience  Some general and recent knowledge regarding behavioral neuroscience  Some general and recent knowledge regarding study of animal behavior  The laboratory component of this course will provide the student with in depth exposure to basic
neuroanatomy and comparative animal behavior, and will illustrate principles of sensory processing that supplement material presented in class

Requirements: A. 40%  Quizzes (4 total): Format is mostly multiple-choice, but may include a small number of short
answer. Each quiz will cover no more than 4 chapters. Quizzes are not "officially" cumulative, but will
build on understanding of previous material. Quizzes may be on-line or in class. B. 30%  In-class Application Activities (6 total): Generally, these will be group activities completed in-
class, but may include individual out-of-class preparatory work. C. 30%  Final Project: (Due during the Final Exam)

*A grade of incomplete is only assigned in extremely unusual circumstances. Such situations require extensive documentation and approval of faculty supervisors. It is only an option if a student is passing the class and is typically only awarded when a student has completed the majority of the class work and is only missing one or two exams or assignments. If a grade of incomplete is approved, a written plan for completion of the coursework must be developed by the instructor and student and approved by the faculty supervisor.

Attendance and Absences: Attendance is not part of your grade, but it is strongly recommended that you come to every class. You are responsible for all lecture material, announcements, in-class work, and quizzes from any class that you miss. That includes announcements regarding assignments, readings, changes to the syllabus, etc. If you miss class please check eLC or contact a fellow student for any important updates. DO NOT email me to inquire about what was covered that day, I will not respond.

"What if I miss a quiz?" As a general rule, quizzes CANNOT be made up. The only exception is below:  If you have a documented, university-approved reason for missing a quiz, you will be allowed a make-up quiz (format may differ from normal). You must talk to me at least one week ahead of time unless the absence is an emergency that makes doing so impossible.

"What if I miss an in-class application activity?"  AA's CANNOT be made up. I have tentatively planned for 9 total AA's throughout the semester, with only 6 counting towards your final grade. The dates of these AA's are subject to change, please check eLC periodically for updates to the schedule.

Group Work: For in-class group work, you will work with the same team all semester. A single copy of each assignment will be turned in by each group and all members will receive the same grade. If asymmetrical contribution becomes a significant problem, the instructor reserves the right to conduct confidential peer-evaluations where members will evaluate and explain the contributions of their team members.

Academic Honesty: As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty," and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: www.uga.edu/honesty. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is NOT a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.

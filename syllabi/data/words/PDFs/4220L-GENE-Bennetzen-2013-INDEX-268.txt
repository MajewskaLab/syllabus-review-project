GENE4220L
Bioinformatics and modeling laboratory Spring 2013
Course description: A hands-on look at the role of bioinformatics in genetic and genomic analyses. This combination lecture/laboratory course will cover genomics and database searching, and will introduce students to RNA expression, proteomics, metabolomic and regulatory modeling approaches to the understanding of genetics and disease.
Class Time & Location: Monday and Wednesday, 9:05 AM to 12:05 PM, Life Sciences C128
Prerequisites: GENE3200
Grading: This course is will be graded A-F with a total of 400 points (200 points per instructor). This is a laboratory class with ~2 hours of lecture/demonstration per week by the instructors and ~4 hours of "hands on" laboratory exercises supervised by the course assistant and/or instructor. Grades in the first half (Bennetzen) will be based upon performance on lab exercises and reading assignments (40%), exams (50%) and class participation (10%). Grades in the second half (Arnold) will be based upon weekly laboratory reports (90%) and class participation (10%).
In the first half of the course, assignments are due when assigned, usually at the end of each lab period. In the second half, laboratory reports are due one week from their day of assignment (usually a Tuesday) on the following Tuesday. Late assignments will only be accepted if the delay or absence is cleared with the instructor prior to the occurrence except in cases of emergency.
Text Book: The text is Discovering Genomics, Proteomics and Bioinformatics, Second Edition by Campbell and Heyer, Benjamin Cummings, 2007. It is available from the campus bookstore. NOTE: A textbook is required for class. You will use it each day for lab exercises.
Instructors: (Office hours will be arranged for each instructor)
Dr. Jonathan Arnold Life Sciences C308B 542-1449 arnold@uga.edu
Dr. Jeff Bennetzen Life Sciences C426A 542-3698 maize@uga.edu

GENE (CBIO) 4310/6310 Genetic Approaches to Developmental Neuroscience

UGA, Fall 2020

2:00-3:15pm Tues, Thurs. -- Synchronous Zoom meetings Zoom meeting ID link: https://zoom.us/j/92558582843?pwd=cWtQMU1xa25JVzRnYkFGVXpYWEMvUT09 Instructor : Jonathan Eggenschwiler. PhD, Office: Coverdell Rm. 245B, Phone: 706-542-2813 email: jeggensc@uga.edu

Course status - Online: All mini-lectures, discussions and interactive exercises will be conducted as synchronous zoom sessions that allow for interactive discussion during and after the session. I will record the zoom sessions and make them available on ELC for students who cannot attend classes. Additional support/feedback on course content and homework exercises will be provided via office hours. General information and recommendations with respect to safety measures in light of the SARS-Cov-2/Covid19 pandemic are provided at the end of this document below.

Office Hours: Set by appointment. Remote O.H. meetings held via zoom are strongly preferred. Zoom mtg link: https://zoom.us/j/92558582843?pwd=cWtQMU1xa25JVzRnYkFGVXpYWEMvUT 09
In person/face-to-face meetings may be requested, but will be held exclusively outside with students/instructor required to wear face coverings.

Course Description: The course covers contemporary approaches to the study of neural
development, emphasizing genetic and molecular techniques. Topics include generation, patterning, differentiation, and survival of neurons, axon growth and guidance, target selection, synapse formation/elimination, topographic map formation, activity-dependent mechanisms of connectivity, and the relationship between neural development and behavior. Topics will primarily draw from examples in Drosophila and vertebrate systems. Reading will be mainly from the primary literature with textbook reading and reviews provided for background. This course relies partially on discussion of the topics in the classroom.

Reading assignments: Reading assignments will include approximately 12-20 pages from the
primary literature each week with optional (additional) reading from the textbook/review literature. Reading materials will be provided electronically. The primary reference textbook (optional, but recommended) is Development of the Nervous System (DNS)--see pg. 7 for details.

Grading/writing assignments (Assignments highlighted): Ideally, your motivation in the course should emphasize learning and
understanding the material, rather than on the nature of your final grade. That said, grades are usually necessary to provide a sufficient incentive to work hard. Grades will be based on performance on four types of exercises: 1. In class participation (20% of final grade). Evaluation based on quality and
quantity of participation. This will include concept mapping exercises. Please don't underestimate the importance of the participation component. 2. Exam question proposals (2%). Students will propose potential exam questions for the midterm exam. The questions will be evaluated and the best ones will appear on the midterm exam (with some tweaking). 3. Two short answer-based, open resource, take-home exams (midterm and final, 30% of final grade each). 4. A final paper (18% of final grade). Students enrolled in Gene6310 or students taking 4310 with Honors option must write this in the format of a grant proposal. Students in 4310 (non-honors) may write the final paper as a discussion of the literature (with more information to come).
Final grades will be determined based on a "curated" curve. The relationship between the average total score for the class and the letter grade it corresponds to will be set by comparing the average performance of this class compared with that of the class in previous years.
Prerequisites: - GENE3200 (or CBIO3800, preferably both)
Learning Outcomes: After taking this course you will be able to ...
1) Interpret and discuss the content of scientific primary literature, highlighting the questions the experimenters are asking, the methods used, the results and conclusions of the study.
2) Construct concept maps connecting the ideas and concepts within selected primary literature reading and discussion.
3) Design effective experimental approaches to scientific questions when presented as in-class thought exercises and exam questions.
4) Recognize and explain the basics of early neural development in the organisms covered in the readings.
5) Write a research report incorporating recent primary literature to explain a given topic in Developmental Neuroscience.
Instructional Methods: This is a discussion-based course that will incorporate some lecture and
some active learning strategies when more information than is provided in the primary literature is appropriate. Short, pre-recorded introductory videos with closed captioning will be provided via eLC prior to discussions of the primary

Mycology - PATH (PBIO) 4200/6200 - 4200L/6200L Fall 2022, 4 credits

Course Goals: Students will gain an appreciation of the diversity of fungi and a basic understanding of their biology, ecology, genetics, morphology and taxonomy. Groups of organisms traditionally classified with the fungi will also be discussed. Students will also learn how to collect, isolate, culture, and identify fungi.

100 points 100 points 100 points 50 points 100 points 50 points = 500 pts.

(20%) (20%) (20%) (10%) (20%) (10%) (100%)

A = 92% to 100%; A- = 90% to 91%; B+ = 87% to 89%; B = 82% to 86%; B- = 80% to 81%; C+ = 77% to 79%; C = 70% to 76%; D = 60% to 69%; F < 60%

Exams (300 points): There will be three exams throughout the semester (100 points each). Exams will include matching, fill in the blank, short answer, and essay questions. There will also be a lab component to every exam. To make up an exam, you must have a legitimate excuse and make every effort to contact the instructor in advance or you will receive a zero.

Lab notebook and lab participation (50 pts): Each lab will consist of several stations and/or activities. Your observations must be documented and any questions posed in lab must be answered. The notebook will be graded for completeness and returned prior to Thanksgiving break. Photographs are acceptable, but must be labeled and organized within the notebook. The lab notebook can consist of paper in a binder, a composition

notebook, or anything else that you can keep organized and bound together. Your lab participation points are based on lab participation and attendance. You must have a legitimate excuse and make every effort to contact the instructor in advance if you will miss lab.
Fungal collection (100 pts): A collection of fungi independently collected from the environment, which could include the woods, campus, or your apartment, but not collected from a culture collection, herbarium, another class, the grocery store, your friend, or your research project, will be a major component of the lab. The specimens must be properly preserved or isolated and identified to the genus level. Additional information on the collection will be provided early in the semester.
Presentation/Poster (50 pts): Graduate students will be required to give a 10minute presentation to the class toward the end of the semester on a topic related to Mycology. Undergrads will be required to present a poster (in groups of three or four) to the class during the poster session at the end of the semester on a topic related to Mycology. Awards will be given for the best presentation and the best poster. Topics for the poster/presentation should be exciting, cutting-edge mycology, not boring and Wikipedia-like essays, and need to be approved by the instructor. Additional information on the presentation/poster will be provided later in the semester.
Academic honesty: I expect all students to follow the UGA honor code. Any cheating or other academic dishonesty will be reported to the Office of the Vice President of Instruction for action. The university's academic honesty policy may be found at: https://honesty.uga.edu/_resources/documents/academic_honesty_policy_2017.pdf "I will be academically honest in all of my work and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others."

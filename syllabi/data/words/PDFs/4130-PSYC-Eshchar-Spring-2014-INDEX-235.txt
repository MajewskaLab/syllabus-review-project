The objective of this course is to provide a detailed introduction to biological psychology. We will explore the biological and physiological mechanisms that underlie human and non-human behavior, look at the mechanism of perception and sensation, and see how this information can be used for practical applications. Lectures and readings will initially focus on anatomy, the nervous system, the senses, and the effects of psychoactive drugs, and then progress to utilize that fundamental knowledge to explain behavior (such as emotion, stress, and sleep).

A grade of incomplete is only assigned in extremely unusual circumstances. Such situations require extensive documentation and approval of faculty supervisors. It is only an option if a student is passing the class and is typically only awarded when a student has completed the majority of the classwork and is only missing one or two exams or assignments. If a grade of incomplete is approved, a written plan for completion of the coursework must be developed by the instructor and student and approved by the faculty supervisor.

Classroom experience and readings Students should read the assigned material before class and come to class prepared to discuss that material. Since this course may be more technical than some other psychology courses, I encourage students to contact me with questions often. I check my email a lot, so feel free to ask questions via email at any time. I also encourage you to meet with other students to discuss the readings, exams, or assignments.

Computers are welcome, as long as you use them for studying. There will be no make up exams without a university approved (or medical) documentation.

Office hours: by appointment only.

WILD 4060-6060 Ornithology - Course Policies and Tentative Schedule Spring 2022
Lecture: 11:30 - 12:20 MWF; Room: 1-304 (bldg. 1040-0304) Lab: Fri 08:00-11:10; Room: 1-101 (bldg. 1040-0101)
Instructors: Clark Rushing, For. Res. 3-409, email: Clark.Rushing@uga.edu Sonia M. Hernandez, email: shernz@uga.edu; 706 296-3909 Teaching assistant: Julia Silva Seixas Julia.SilvaSeixas@uga.edu
Course Objectives: To familiarize students with avian biology, including anatomy and physiology, behavior, ecology, evolution, and conservation. Lab and field exercises will emphasize taxonomy and identification of North American birds through use of field labs and study skins.
Texts: Required: (1) Gill, Frank B. 2006. Ornithology. Third edition. W. H. Freeman and Co. (2) A field guide. We recommend Peterson, Roger T. 1980. A field guide to the birds of eastern and central North America. Fourth edition. Houghton Mifflin. Or Sibley, David A. The Sibley Field Guide to Birds of Eastern North America. Knopf. (paperback). In addition, we may post selected Readings.
Grading: Your grade will be based on a total of 650 points, split between two lecture exams (100 points each), a non-cumulative final exam (100 points), two laboratory exams (100 points each), a research paper outline (25 pts), a research paper draft (25 pts) and a research paper final draft (100 pts).
Research Paper: Each student, or a team of two students, will work on a research project focusing on a topic of their choice (Start thinking now! Right now!). A 1-page proposal, outlining the title, nature of the question, indicating some preliminary review of literature, and methods is due February 2nd. The outline of the paper will be due March 14th. The first draft of the paper will be due April 4th. The first draft should have a welldeveloped Introduction, Materials and Methods and at least preliminary results if your data collection is ongoing, plus an outline of the Discussion and the Literature Cited. We will return edits to you and your final draft will be due April 27th. The paper will be in proper scientific format (see major ornithological journals such as Ornithology and Ornithological Applications). We expect you to use scientific writing and pay attention to grammar, spelling and appropriate syntax. Papers are to be typed, double-spaced and include clearly presented results in text, figures and tables. Submit your original data (as a field notebook, spreadsheet etc.) with the final draft. A discussion and a handout on how to conduct the research and formatting details on how to write the paper will be delivered during the first few lab periods.

____________________________________________________________________________

Note that field trips will meet in a variety of locations. You may be responsible for your own transportation to and from field trip sites, but often we will have a van that will meet at Warnell and drive to the site. Also note that lab times differ from week to week. Lab times and activities are subject to change due to a number of factors but primarily because of uncertainties related to weather. We will remind you of lab and exam times, primarily during class and through email, but you are ultimately expected to be at the correct place on time or you will be left behind.

All academic work must meet the standards contained in "A Culture of Honesty. "Students are responsible for informing themselves about these standards before performing any academic work. The link to more detailed information about academic honesty can be found at: http://www.uga.edu/honesty/

UGA adheres to guidance from the University System of Georgia and the recommendations from Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) related to quarantine and isolation. Since this may be updated periodically, we encourage you to review the latest guidance here. The following information is based on guidance last updated on December 29, 2021.

Face coverings:

Following guidance from the University System of Georgia, face coverings are recommended for all individuals while inside campus facilities. In addition, we ask that you wear masks when being transported in vans to field trips.

How can I obtain the COVID-19 vaccine?

University Health Center is scheduling appointments for students through the UHC Patient Portal (https://patientportal.uhs.uga.edu/login_dualauthentication.aspx). Learn more here - https://www.uhs.uga.edu/healthtopics/covid-vaccine.

The Georgia Department of Health, pharmacy chains and local providers also offer the COVID-19 vaccine at no cost to you. To find a COVID-19 vaccination location near you, please go to: https://georgia.gov/covid-vaccine.

In addition, the University System of Georgia has made COVID-19 vaccines available at 15 campuses statewide and you can locate one here: https://www.usg.edu/vaccination

What do I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?

Students showing COVID-19 symptoms should self-isolate and get tested. You can schedule an appointment with the University Health Center by calling 706-542-1162 (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5p.m.). Please DO NOT walk-in. For emergencies and after-hours care, see https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies.

What do I do if I test positive for COVID-19? (Isolation guidance)

If you test positive for COVID-19 at any time, either through a PCR test, an Antigen test, or a home test kit, you are required to report it through the DawgCheck Test Reporting Survey. Follow the instructions provided to you when you report your positive test result in DawgCheck.

As of December 29, 2021, when an individual receive a positive COVID-19 test: Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, should:

 Stay home for 5 days.
 If you have no symptoms or your symptoms are resolving after 5 days, you can leave your house and return to class.
 Continue to wear a mask around others for 5 additional days.
What do I do if I have been exposed to COVID-19? (Quarantine guidance)
If you have been exposed (within 6 feet for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period - unmasked**) to someone with COVID-19 or to someone with a positive COVID-19 test and you are:
 Boosted, or have become fully vaccinated within the last 6 months (Moderna or Pfizer vaccine) or within the last 2 months (J&J vaccine)
o You do not need to quarantine at home and may come to class.
o You should wear a mask around others for 10 days.
o If possible, get tested on day 5.
o If you develop symptoms, get tested and isolate at home until test results are received, then proceed in accordance with the test results.
 Unvaccinated, or became fully vaccinated more than 6 months ago (Moderna or Pfizer vaccine) or more than 2 months ago (J&J vaccine) and have not received a booster:
o You must quarantine at home for 5 days. After that you may return to class but continue to wear a mask around others for 5 additional days.
o If possible, get tested on day 5.
o If you develop symptoms, get tested and isolate at home until test results are received, then proceed in accordance with the test results.
** "Masked-to-masked" encounters are not currently considered an exposure; this type of interaction would not warrant quarantine.
You should report the need to quarantine on DawgCheck (https://dawgcheck.uga.edu/), and communicate directly with your faculty to coordinate your coursework while in quarantine. If you need additional help, reach out to Student Care and Outreach (sco@uga.edu) for assistance.
Well-being, mental health, and student support
If you or someone you know needs assistance, you are encouraged to contact Student Care & Outreach in the Division of Student Affairs at 706-542-7774 or visit https://sco.uga.edu/. They will help you navigate any difficult circumstances you may be facing by connecting you with the

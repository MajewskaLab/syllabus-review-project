Objectives: Evolutionary ecology examines how the abiotic and biotic environment shapes evolutionary dynamics. This class will explore the fundamental concepts and techniques used in evolutionary ecology. We will examine general themes that cover a diversity of organisms in terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems to highlight interactions among evolutionary and ecological processes. We will cover theory and applications, including examples in conservation and global change biology, phylogenetics, and community ecology.
This course is divided into three main sections: (1) Microevolution (agents and targets of selection, quantitative genetics, life history evolution, and population dynamics), (2) Macroevolution (phylogenetics, speciation, and coevolution), and (3) Community Ecology (evolutionary consequences of biotic interactions: competition, predation, disease and mutualisms). The last section draws on micro- and macro-evolutionary concepts.
Course Requirements: Students taking this course need to understand the basics of evolution and population ecology. Coursework equivalent to GENE 3000 and/or ECOL 3500 should provide this background. The course will consist of a combination of lectures, classroom activities, and discussions. Students will write weekly response papers to the readings and a research proposal on a topic of their choosing. In addition, students will take a mid-term and a final exam.

Materials: There is no textbook for this seminar. We will distribute readings on ELC.
Values Statement: We are committed to helping you continue to develop as scholars and scientists by creating an inclusive space and equitable learning environment in our class. Please use speech and actions that communicate respect for diversity and honor each individual's uniqueness. Diversity of race, skin color, ethnicity, sexual orientation, country of origin, physical ability, and religion enriches our community.
Accessibility Statement: We are committed to helping every student succeed in this course. Your performance depends on active participation in classroom discussions and activities and excellent written work. If there are circumstances that may affect your ability to succeed, please speak with us at the beginning of the semester so that we can develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. We are happy to make accommodations for students with a documented disability. If you have a disability and need accommodations to participate fully in this class, contact the UGA Disability Resource Center, 114 Clark Howell Hall, Athens, GA 30602. Phone: 706.542.8719 Fax: 706.542.7719 Email: dsinfo@uga.edu; https://drc.uga.edu. All accommodations must be approved through the UGA Disability Resource Center. Please note that accommodations cannot be provided retroactively.
COVID-19 Accommodations: This class will be synchronous and entirely virtual during the first half of the semester and will transition to a hybrid model if deemed safe during the second half. The zoom link for the first half of the semester is: https://zoom.us/j/5269168702 and the second half is: https://zoom.us/j/93053233152?pwd=dUhyRW1VdExnV3U2SnVBL05iZStqdz09. We will video all Tuesday and Thursday lectures and post the recording and the powerpoint file to eLC. We will not record Wednesday discussion sections. We do not require a note from your doctor if you miss a class, but we will require a note if you miss an exam. If possible, we prefer for you to turn your video on during class time, as it helps us to assess comprehension.
Student responsibilities
Readings, attendance and participation: To succeed in this course, you will need to attend, complete all readings, and participate in discussions. It is your responsibility to read assignments before class, prepare the response paper, and bring specific questions about the readings to class. We do not use a standard textbook for this course. We will provide ample opportunity for both introverts and extraverts to actively participate in class, through written work, collaborations with other students, and group discussions.
Graduate student-led discussions: During the semester, students enrolled in ECOL 6500 will lead one discussion section. We ask students to meet with us prior to class to go over the strategy for the discussion. Student discussion leaders will be graded on preparedness and quality of discussion.
Writing projects: You will complete several writing projects for this course. The write-up for each assignment should be submitted electronically. Please see the relevant handouts for more information on these assignments.
Response papers: You will prepare short reports (1-2 page) on weekly readings. In summaries of empirical papers, please: 1) identify the research question, 2) briefly describe the methods, 3) relate the main results, 4) explain what is important about the paper, 5) briefly discuss what could have been improved, and 6) list 2-3 questions that you had about the study. In summaries of review articles, list questions that you had about the paper, or
2

aspects that you found confusing. Response papers will be due before class on the indicated day, generally Tuesday of each week (see "Class schedule" on pp. 4-8). Response papers will not be accepted after 12:00 PM (noon) on the due date. Each response paper is worth 3 points. There are 14 response papers over the course of the semester, but you only need to complete 12 to get full credit for this activity. If you submit all 14 response papers, you can earn a maximum of 42 points (i.e., 6 bonus points).
Grant proposal: You will complete a grant proposal on a topic of your choosing relating to evolutionary ecology. The purpose of this activity is to identify a topic and research question in need of further study, pose alternative hypotheses, identify predictions, and design an experiment. Over the course of the semester, you will turn in the topic for your proposal, a summary including hypotheses (which will be peer-reviewed), and a final draft. Assume your budget is not a concern.
Peer review: The peer review process is central to the dissemination of new concepts, ideas, hypotheses, and results in science. During this semester, I will ask you to critique the grant proposal outline of one of your classmates. The objective of this assignment is twofold: 1) to acquaint you with the peer review process, and 2) to help you improve your own understanding of evolutionary ecology. The peer review of the grant outline will be done during class time.
Late Policy: Late assignments will be penalized 5% per day of the total available points. We will not accept late response papers or final papers (grant proposals). A paper will be considered "on time" if we receive an uncorrupted electronic version submitted on or before the deadline.
Make-up exams: There will be no makeup exams. Athletes and students who have an excused absence during the time of an exam need to arrange to take the exam in advance. If you fall ill before the exam, contact us as soon as possible and bring a doctor's note explaining that you were unable to take the exam. In the case of an excused illness, we will arrange an alternative time for the exam.
University Honor Code & Academic Honesty: Students are expected to follow the University of Georgia Student Honor Code and should understand that every instance of a suspected violation will be reported. UGA Student Honor code: "I will be academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others." A Culture of Honesty, the University's policy and procedures for handling cases of suspected dishonesty, can be found at https://honesty.uga.edu/
You are responsible for informing yourself about the university's standards before performing any academic work. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Please ask if you have questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy. Any form of possible academic dishonesty will be reported to the UGA Office of the Vice President for Instruction.
*A note on plagiarism: We encourage you to discuss ideas, concepts, and assignments with your peers. However, we expect that all work that you submit to be your own. Please ensure you are familiar with rules of conduct regarding plagiarism, of other student's work and of sources such as the primary literature and web sites. Any student found plagiarizing will receive an F in the course. We suggest that you consult this website for more information on what constitutes plagiarism: http://plagiarism.arts.cornell.edu/tutorial/index.cfm.

GRADING SCALE AND EVALUATION:
Quizzes: There will be 5 quizzes each worth 10 points. Quizzes consist of 10 multiple choice/true-false questions worth 1 pt each. Quizzes are timed at 10 minutes. Each quiz may be attempted twice with the higher of the two scores being recorded in the gradebook. Questions come from a question bank so exact combination of questions on a second attempt may not be the same as first attempt. Quizzes will open no later than the beginning of each module and are due Saturday 11:30pm of the indicated week.. All quizzes are closed note. The lowest quiz score will be dropped.
Research Highlights: Students will read and answer questions on relevant literature. There will be 5 of these assignments each worth 40 points. The lowest of these scores will be dropped. Research highlights are due at 11:30pm Saturday of the indicated week. Research Highlights for section #57008 will cover certain topics in more detail as necessary for students pursuing microbiology as a major field of study.
Exams (on eLC listed under "quizzes"): There will be 4 module exams and 1 cumulative final exam. Each exam is worth 100 points. Module exams are timed at 90 minutes, final exam is timed at 3 hours. Module exams will open at 8am on the day before due date. Final exam will open on 8am on the day of the due date. All exams have the same format: 30 multiple choice/true- false questions worth 2.5 pts each and 5 written response questions worth 5 points each. There is only one attempt for each exam. All exams are closed note. The lowest exam score will de dropped. Therefore; if a student is satisfied with their grade, they may choose not to take the final exam.
Written Response Sentence Limit: In order to provide timely grade feedback, Exam and Research Highlight answers will be limited to 1 paragraph (4 sentences) or less per question. Answers that do not fit this structural criteria will be evaluated at half credit. If indicated on assignment, some questions may have a limit of less than 4 sentences.
Packback Curiosity Questions: Students will post curiosity questions and respond to at least two questions from their peers on the indicated weeks (with a due time of 11:30pm). There will be 10 of these assignments each worth 5 points. Packback questions are due on Tuesdays and responses due that Friday. No Packback scores will be dropped. Material from questions/responses highlighted in the course may be included on quizzes and exams.
Students will start the course with full credit for Packback participation. Failure to upload a unique question and/or responses will result in that full assignment points being deducted. That is; if any portion of the assignment is incomplete or late the score for that entire assignment will be 0/5points. Restating another students question/response will also result in the full assignment points being deducted.

LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION: Strong letters of recommendation come from referring students who we know well. Students who are considering requesting letters of recommendation should meet (on Zoom) regularly with Dr. Scott and their TA throughout the entire semester or in the several months preceding a letter request. Decisions on letters of recommendation take into consideration a student's overall course grade, how well we know the student, and number of students requesting letters.
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: Excerpt from A Culture of Honesty: "No student shall perform, attempt to perform, or assist another in performing any act of dishonesty on academic work to be submitted for academic credit or advancement. A student does not have to intend to violate the honesty policy to be found in violation. For example, plagiarism, intended or unintended, is a violation of this policy" Additionally, students must agree that " I will be academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate the dishonest of others."
A complete description of academic dishonesty may be found at http://www.uga.edu/honesty and in the student honor code. If a student is found in violation of the academic integrity policy the University's policy and procedures for handling cases of suspected dishonesty can be found at http://www.uga.edu/ovpi
Respondus Monitor will be required for all Quizzes and Exams. Respondus monitor requires a functional webcam and microphone. Information about respondus monitor can be found at the following link:

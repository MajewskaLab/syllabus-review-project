COURSE INFORMATION ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY LAB (BIOL 1104L)
Biology 1104L is a one-credit hour course that provides a hands-on, inquiry-based introduction for nonscience majors to the remarkable diversity of life that inhabits planet Earth. The corresponding lecture course, BIOL 1104, is a pre-requisite or a co-requisite for BIOL 1104L.
PRINCIPLE OBJECTIVES OF THE COURSE: Upon completion of this laboratory course, students will have an understanding of the
scientific process as applied in aquatic ecosystems and should be able to: (1) identify organisms belonging to the major groups of life forms; (2) describe the behavior, mode of nutrition, principal characteristics and phylogenetic relationships of the major groups of organisms; (3) describe interactions of organisms with each other and with their environment; (4) describe the structure and function of the mammalian heart, renal system and sensory system.
The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.

Desk copies of the lab manual, corresponding lecture course text, and photo atlases are on reserve in the BLC for student use. BLC hours are from 8:30 AM - 7:00 PM, Monday through Thursday; 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM, Friday. The BLC is closed on weekends.
TEXT -- REQUIRED: 1. Lab Manual - Lab Manual for Organismal Biology, 2007 edition, M. Darley and C. Teare Ketter. Bring your lab manual to lab each week. 2. Photo Atlas for Biology, J.W. Perry and D. Morton
WWW ACCESS TO COURSE INFORMATION, SYLLABUS AND POLICIES: For your convenience, the Division of Biological Sciences has created a World-Wide Web page
that provides you with immediate access to course information. A copy of the lab course syllabus, a list of assignment due dates and policy information is also included. Log in to eLC and choose BIOL 1104L from your courses listed to access information about this laboratory course.

THE FIRST LAB: Labs will meet the first full week of classes (week of January 11th). Before the first lab: (1)
read and understand pages 1-9 in the Lab Manual; (2) read and understand the first lab exercise, "Some of Lake Herrick's Critters"; (3) complete the Pre-Lab Assignment associated with that lab (pp. 1-1 - 12) and have it ready to turn in for credit at the beginning of lab.
DRESS CODE: Your legs must be completely covered (long pants or long skirt). Your feet must be completely
covered (no open-toed or open-heeled shoes). Failure to comply with the dress code will result in dismissal from lab and will be marked as an excused absence. You will be given one week to complete a make-up assignment. If the work is not completed in that time, you will have 35 points deducted from your total points for lab.
ATTENDANCE/TARDINESS: *Students who miss four labs at any point in the semester, any combination of excused or unexcused absences, will receive an F in the course.*
Attendance is required for this class. Missing even one class means that you have missed a significant portion of the course. DO NOT schedule any other appointments or activities during the time that you are scheduled to be in lab.
Missing labs with a valid excuse: A "valid" excuse is one that is written, verifiable, and covers the date and time of your scheduled lab class. Oversleeping and job conflicts do not constitute acceptable excuses. Missing a lab with a valid excuse allows you to make-up the lab provided that you contact your lab instructor within 48 hours of the absence. If you know in advance that you will miss a lab with a valid excuse, contact your GLA before the lab for reassignment to another lab period. Make-up assignments are due within one week of the missed lab and may include any or all of the following: completing the lab with a different section, submitting homework, quizzes, or any other assignment associated with the missed lab, or by completing an alternate assignment designated by the GLA or course instructor. Students who fail to complete the make-up work within the allocated time will not receive credit for the lab exercise. You are responsible for all material and data presented and gathered in lab. Please note that any missed lab for a valid excuse will still be marked as an excused absence, even if you make up the lab in another lab section.
Missing labs without a valid excuse: For each lab that is missed without a valid excuse, students will automatically receive a minimum 35-point deduction (this includes points for missed quizzes) from your total lab points; if a lab is worth more than 35 points for that day, you will lose the total number of points for that day.
Tardiness and leaving lab early without permission are not tolerated in lab. Quizzes are given during the first 15 minutes of class; if you arrive 10 minutes late you will only have 5 minutes to take the quiz. If you arrive to lab more than 15 minutes late you will be marked as absent without a valid excuse and will not be allowed to take the quiz, but work that is due that day will be accepted and you will be able to stay and complete the lab for the day. If you leave lab early without permission, you will be marked as absent without a valid excuse (even if you have taken the quiz) and will receive a deduction of 35 points from your total lab points.
Assignments are due in class on the days indicated on your syllabus or by your instructor. Each day that an assignment is late, you will lose 10% of the assignment's total point value.
Students who have missed four or more labs due to extenuating circumstances with valid documentation and wish to avoid a failing grade should withdraw from the course or request an Incomplete. After the midpoint in the semester, permission to withdraw must be obtained from Linda Edge (542-3564) in the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs.

COURSE GRADES: There are 500 possible points for the semester, earned as outlined on the Lab Outline and
Summary of Points. There is no final exam for the lab course as your work is evaluated weekly. Final grades are based on your accumulated points and will be awarded as follows:

A (465-500) A- (450-464)

B+ (435-449) B (415-434) B- (400-414)

C+ (385-399) C (365-384) C- (350-364)

D (300-349) F (< 300 pts)

There will be no extra credit or bonus points given. Historically, students who attend their lab classes, prepare for lab on a weekly basis, and turn in all of their written work on time, earn good grades for their efforts.

You should keep a record of all your lab grades and save your graded papers until the end of the semester. ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT A GRADE MUST BE BROUGHT TO YOUR GLA's ATTENTION, IN WRITTEN FORM WITH A THOROUGH EXPLANATION AS TO WHY YOU DISAGREE WITH THE GRADE, WITHIN ONE WEEK OF THE GRADE BEING POSTED. Under no circumstance will a grade be changed after the last day of classes.

INCOMPLETES: The grade of Incomplete (I) is given to students who for reason of accident or illness were unable
to complete a segment of the course. In no case will an Incomplete be given as a means of avoiding a failing grade.

ACADEMIC HONESTY: As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic
honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty," and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: www.uga.edu/honesty. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.

GROUP WORK: Many of your laboratory experiences in BIOL 1104L will be based upon work completed in
small groups. We encourage you to interact with your GLA and your classmates when completing your in-class work and your homework. However, you are expected to complete all written assignments by yourself (i.e. showing independent thought and voice) unless otherwise directed by your GLA.
In the sciences, all co-authors on papers are held accountable for the accuracy and originality of the published work. Similarly, in lab assignments, when a student's name is on a group project, this implies that s/he takes responsibility for the accuracy and originality of the entire assignment (and also for any academic dishonesty that may have been involved).

Students often have difficulties determining how to demonstrate independent effort when they turn in a group assignment (i.e. "We all did the same thing so shouldn't the work that we turn in be the same?"). Please carefully read Expectations about Group Work & Plagiarism, located on eLC, under the link "Plagiarism." You are responsible for being familiar with this document. If you ever have a question about whether or not you have crossed the fine line between group work and independent work, ask your GLA for assistance before you hand in an assignment.

Academic Integrity UGA students are bound by an academic honor code that details rights and responsibilities for study. You should be aware that this code provides serious sanctions for academic dishonesty (including but not limited to plagiarism and cheating). We expect that you will follow the honor code. If you have any questions about the honor code or about what constitutes plagiarism or cheating, please either check the UGA student handbook (https://honesty.uga.edu/AcademicHonesty-Policy/) or come speak with us.
Accommodations for Students with Disabilities If you have an identified disability and will need accommodations, you should first contact the Disability Resource Center (http://drc.uga.edu/; 114 Clark Howell Hall; (706)542-8719). They will discuss the UGA process and work with you to access supportive services. If you have a learning disability, the University will require you to provide supportive documentation and will develop an approved accommodation sheet for you. Accommodations cannot be provided until the accommodation sheet is established and we have met to discuss its applicability to this course. Accommodations cannot be provided retroactively. All conversations will be strictly confidential.
Coronavirus Information for Students
Face Coverings/Mask Use The University of Georgia requires all faculty, staff, students and visitors to wear an appropriate face covering while inside campus facilities/buildings. Face covering use is in addition to and is not a substitute for social distancing. Anyone not using a face covering when required will be asked to wear one or must leave the area. Reasonable accommodations may be made for those who are unable to wear a face covering for documented health reasons. Students seeking an accommodation related to face coverings should contact Disability Services at https://drc.uga.edu/.
DawgCheck Please perform a quick symptom check each weekday on DawgCheck--on the UGA app or website--whether you feel sick or not. It will help health providers monitor the health situation on campus: https://dawgcheck.uga.edu/
What do I do if I have symptoms? Students showing symptoms should self-isolate and schedule an appointment with the University Health Center by calling 706-542-1162 (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.). Please DO NOT walkin. For emergencies and after-hours care, see https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies.

What do I do if I am notified that I have been exposed? Students who learn they have been directly exposed to COVID-19 but are not showing symptoms should self-quarantine for 14 days consistent with Department of Public Health (DPH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Please correspond with your instructor via email, with a cc: to Student Care & Outreach at sco@uga.edu, to coordinate continuing your coursework while self-quarantined. If you develop symptoms, you should contact the University Health Center to make an appointment to be tested. You should continue to monitor your symptoms daily on DawgCheck.
How do I get a test? Students who are demonstrating symptoms of COVID-19 should call the University Health Center. UHC is offering testing by appointment for students; appointments may be booked by calling 706-542-1162.
UGA will also be recruiting asymptomatic students to participate in surveillance tests. Students living in residence halls, Greek housing and off-campus apartment complexes are encouraged to participate.
What do I do if I test positive? Any student with a positive COVID-19 test is required to report the test in DawgCheck and should self-isolate immediately. Students should not attend classes in-person until the isolation period is completed. Once you report the positive test through DawgCheck, UGA Student Care and Outreach will follow up with you.

EVALUATIONS Exams: There will be two examinations (including final). The exams will consist of multiplechoice, short answer, fill in the blank, short essay, and/or matching. These will test your knowledge of material covered in the text, lectures, and required supplemental readings. There is a large amount of information in each of these sections; therefore, it is imperative that you distribute your studying.

Assignments: There will be 3 assignments during the semester. Assignments will be distributed one class week prior to their being due. Assignments must be turned in at the beginning of class on the date due. Late submissions will not be accepted or graded. If you must miss class on the date the assignment is due, please arrange with a classmate to turn them in for you.

MAKE-UP EXAM POLICY Make-up exams will not be given unless appropriate written documentation of an emergent situation (e.g., a doctor's note) can be provided within seven (7) days of the missed exam. I reserve the right to use a different form of assessment in these situations (e.g., essay or oral examination).

CLASS MATERIALS Supplemental lecture materials will be provided in class only. If you must miss a class, please arrange for a classmate to pick up copies for you. Relying on these materials as your sole form of note taking is extremely risky and is discouraged. These materials are not designed to be a study guide; they may or may not contain material that is not discussed. They are provided to facilitate the objectives for this class. In other words, it is vital you maintain your own notes.

CLASS ATTENDANCE Given the cumulative nature of this course, you should not exceed two (2) unexcused absences. Please inform the instructor of your reasons for an absence only if you have a legitimate excuse. Excessive absences are grounds for dismissal from the class and issuance of a "W" (before the withdrawal deadline) or "F" (after the withdrawal deadline).

CLASS ANNOUNCEMENTS Announcements concerning the class and changes in the class schedule will be made in class and/or via e-mail. Therefore, if you attend class and check your University e-mail account frequently, you will stay current.

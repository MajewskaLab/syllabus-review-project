BIOL 2108H: PRINCIPLES OF BIOLOGY II (HONORS) - Fall 2020
Welcome to BIOL 2108H! I am excited be your professor this semester. There is unfortunately no way to learn all there is to know about organismal biology in one semester. With that in mind, a goal of this course is to expose you to the tremendous amount of diversity that exists. We will learn how this diversity arises and changes through time, how it is maintained, quantified, interacts with the environment and other life forms, and how it responds to a changing environment. In addition, I will encourage you to think critically and evaluate scientific information. I want you to leave this course with an appreciation for the diversity of life and confidence in making decisions about biology in your own life. I will do my best to make this class not about memorization of lectures or minute details in a dense textbook, but rather the "big picture" concepts and themes of biology.

The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; I will announce deviations to this plan as necessary.

Course Resources
eLC: Much of the class material (including lectures, slides, quizzes, and exams) as well as general
information/announcements will be on eLC, make sure you have access! Optional textbook: Campbell Biology, 11th edition

Grading Activity Exams Quizzes

Total Points 400 100

Details 4 total, each 100 points 11 total, each 10 points; lowest dropped

% of Grade 80 20

Actual points available may change during the semester and your grade will be adjusted to an actual percentage of available points. Your letter grade for the course will be calculated at the end of the semester and will be based on your final percentage. Your final percentage will be determined by adding the total number of points you have earned, dividing it by the total number of points you could have earned, and multiplying by 100. I will use the following scale to determine letter grades:

Grading grievances If you feel that there has been a mistake in your grade on an exam or quiz, please email me immediately. I will not consider grading appeals beyond one week after posting a grade.
Attendance/participation: This is a fully-online course. You are expected to watch the video lectures uploaded each Tuesday and Thursday of class and take the quizzes and exams before they are due.
Format of Exams There will be four online exams (on eLC) consisting of multiple-choice, true/false, and short answer/essay. Focus will be on application and analysis rather than memorization. No make-ups will be given unless there is a legitimate excuse (e.g., illness with a doctor's note or other emergency/bereavement with appropriate documentation).
Academic Honesty Academic honesty means performing all of your work without plagiarism, cheating, lying, tampering, stealing, giving, or receiving unauthorized assistance from any other person, or using any source of information that is not common knowledge without properly acknowledging the source. WHEN IN DOUBT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE YOU ARE FOLLOWING THESE RULES! The academic honesty policy of the University of Georgia is supplemented by an Honor Code that was adopted by the Student Government Association: I will be academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others. All students agree to abide by this code by signing the UGA Admissions Application. For more information please refer to honesty.uga.edu.
Any person found using unauthorized assistance will be reported immediately to the Office of the Vice President for Instruction and/or the UGA Honesty Office. The minimum penalty for unauthorized assistance is a failing grade on that assignment/exam, and the maximum penalty is suspension from the University.
Disability Accommodations Reasonable accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. The Disability Resource Center in the Division of Student Affairs (114 Clark Howell Hall; 706-542-8719 voice, 706-542-8778 tty) coordinates accommodations and services for students with disabilities. Please notify the instructor of any accommodations needed for the course during the first 2 weeks of the semester.
Mental Health and Wellness Resources If you or someone you know needs assistance, you are encouraged to contact Student Care and Outreach in the Division of Student Affairs at 706-542-7774 or visit https://sco.uga.edu. They will help you navigate any difficult circumstances you may be facing by connecting you with the appropriate resources or services.
UGA has several resources for a student seeking mental health services (https://www.uhs.uga.edu/bewelluga/bewelluga) or crisis support (https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies).
If you need help managing stress anxiety, relationships, etc., please visit BeWellUGA (https://www.uhs.uga.edu/bewelluga/bewelluga) for a list of FREE workshops, classes, mentoring, and health coaching led by licensed clinicians and health educators in the University Health Center.

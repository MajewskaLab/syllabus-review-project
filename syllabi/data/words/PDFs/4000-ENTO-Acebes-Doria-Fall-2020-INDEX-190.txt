Text Book: Daly and Doyen's Introduction to Insect Biology and Diversity. Third Edition. 2012. J. B. Whitfield and A.H. Purcell III
Supplemental Reading Material: Triplehorn, C.A. and N.F. Johnson. 2005. Borror and DeLong's Introduction to the Study of Insects. 7th ed. Thomson Brooks/Cole, Belmont CA, 864 pp.
Course Objectives: The goal of this course is to make you familiar with the fundamentals of insect biology and relationships among insects, plants and other organisms. It will also introduce you to the different specialization within the field of entomology including agriculture, medical and veterinary, apiculture, etc. We hope to give you an appreciation for the diversity of form and function in the insect world by presenting both beneficial and detrimental effects of insects. Hopefully, you will leave this course with a better understanding of how insects affect all other forms of life on the planet.
Laboratory Objectives: In the laboratory, you will learn how to identify commonly encountered insects. We will introduce basic elements of insect morphology and taxonomy. Learning to distinguish unique features of insects will also allow an increased appreciation for insect diversity and a sense of where insects fit in to the animal kingdom.

Attendance: Students are expected to attend class on a regular basis in person or via zoom. If absent from class, it is the responsibility of the student to make up any work that is missed. Grades will be based on the following items:
1. Lecture Exams (3) 2. Laboratory Quizzes (5) 3. Laboratory Exams (2) 4. Insect Collection (1)

Lecture Exams -----------------------------------------------------------------------There will be three lecture exams including the final exam, each worth 100 points for ENTO 4000. Exams will be given in class and will test your knowledge of the material presented during the lecture portion of the class. The first two lecture exams will be given during the semester while the third will serve as the final exam for the course. Students registered for ENTO 6000 will have additional 25 points of questions for each exam. These questions usually will involve an essay-type answer.

Laboratory Quizzes -----------------------------------------------------------------------You will be given five - 10 point quizzes that will be worth a total of 50 points. Quizzes will be administered at the beginning of five labs and will cover insect taxonomy.

Laboratory Exams -----------------------------------------------------------------------There will be two laboratory exams worth 50 points. These exams will test your knowledge of the material presented in the laboratory during the course of the semester.

Insect Collection -----------------------------------------------------------------------You will be required to make an insect collection that will be turned in for grading at the end of the semester. This collection will be worth a total of 100 points. Details on collection requirements and grading will be presented in laboratory.

Grading Policies -----------------------------------------------------------------------First, a review of point values for each required item in the course:

Calculating a Grade 1. Add total points accumulated and divide by 550 (the maximum possible number of points for ENTO 4000) and convert to a percentage.

2. Calculate grade, based on percentage distribution presented below In the example above, the Ent 400 student had 475/550 points, which is rounded to 86%. This is a "B". Plus and minus grades also will be applied according to UGA guidelines.

Table for Finals Grades Course Percentages (Approximate) A 90-100% B 80-89%
C 70-79% D 60-69% F <60%

Coronavirus Information for Students
Face Coverings:
Effective July 15, 2020, the University of Georgia--along with all University System of Georgia (USG) institutions--requires all faculty, staff, students and visitors to wear an appropriate face covering while inside campus facilities/buildings where six feet social distancing may not always be possible. Face covering use is in addition to and is not a substitute for social distancing. Anyone not using a face covering when required will be asked to wear one or must leave the area. Reasonable accommodations may be made for those who are unable to wear a face covering for documented health reasons. Students seeking an accommodation related to face coverings should contact Disability Services at https://drc.uga.edu/.
DawgCheck:
Please perform a quick symptom check each weekday on DawgCheck--on the UGA app or website--whether you feel sick or not. It will help health providers monitor the health situation on campus: https://dawgcheck.uga.edu/
What do I do if I have symptoms?
Students showing symptoms should self-isolate and schedule an appointment with the University Health Center by calling 706-542-1162 (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.). Please DO NOT walkin. For emergencies and after-hours care, see https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies.
What do I do if I am notified that I have been exposed?
Students who learn they have been directly exposed to COVID-19 but are not showing symptoms should self-quarantine for 14 days consistent with Department of Public Health (DPH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Please correspond with your instructor via email, with a cc: to Student Care & Outreach at sco@uga.edu, to coordinate continuing your coursework while self-quarantined. If you develop symptoms, you should contact the University Health Center to make an appointment to be tested. You should continue to monitor your symptoms daily on DawgCheck.
How do I get a test?
Students who are demonstrating symptoms of COVID-19 should call the University Health Center. UHC is offering testing by appointment for students; appointments may be booked by calling 706-542-1162.
UGA will also be recruiting asymptomatic students to participate in surveillance tests. Students living in residence halls, Greek housing and off-campus apartment complexes are encouraged to participate.

What do I do if I test positive?
Any student with a positive COVID-19 test is required to report the test in DawgCheck and should self-isolate immediately. Students should not attend classes in-person until the isolation period is completed. Once you report the positive test through DawgCheck, UGA Student Care and Outreach will follow up with you.

Purpose: To promote dialogue among UGA students, faculty and advisors in premedicine,
pre-dentistry, pre-optometry, pre-podiatry, pharmacy and related fields involving patient care. Topics:

Chosen by students present "the week before." Items discussed in past have included

medical malpractice climate, managed care, distribution and payment of healthcare

resources to the general population, genetic neurological diseases, respiratory intubation,

specialty training for graduates of medical school, "end of life" issues, biomedical ethical

issues and other possible topics that sometimes are discussed at medical school

interviews.

Agenda:

Most sessions begin with Question & Answer session, then comments are

welcomed on upcoming extracurricular activities from any student and officers of UGA

Premed organizations (AED, UGA Premed Club, AMSA, and MPSA/SNMA). Guest

speakers will sometimes present.

Students interested in nursing and allied health disciplines are also invited. All UGA faculty and advisors are invited to attend and contribute. At times, the meetings will be 'switched' to other times to coincide with other AED/Premed activities.

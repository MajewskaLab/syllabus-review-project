Evaluation:

There is a total of 350 possible points in this course.

Exams (300): There will be four exams, three exams during the semester, and a comprehensive final exam. The dates are indicated in the course outline. Each of the exams will be worth 100 points. Students will be allowed to drop their lowest exam score excluding the final (in other words, I will drop the lowest of the first three exams). The final exam cannot be dropped and students must take the comprehensive final exam. If you are absent on a test day (for whatever reason), then the resulting zeroes will be the one dropped. There will be no make-ups.

Attendance (50): Class attendance is expected and will be assessed throughout the semester. If you must miss due to religious holidays, voting/jury duty or medical emergencies please let me know in advance if possible.

Incompletes: A grade of incomplete is only assigned in extremely unusual circumstances. Such situations require extensive documentation and approval of faculty supervisors. It is only an option if a student is passing the class and is typically only awarded when a student has completed the majority of the classwork and is only missing one or two exams or assignments. If a grade of incomplete is approved, a written plan for completion of the coursework must be developed by the instructor and student and approved by the faculty supervisor.

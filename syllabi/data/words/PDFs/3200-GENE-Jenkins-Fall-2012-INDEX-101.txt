Course Description and Learning Outcomes GENE 3200 is a rigorous first course in genetics in which basic genetic concepts are reinforced and learned through problem solving. Since population genetics is covered in GENE (BIOL) 3000, the emphasis of this class will be transmission and molecular genetics. The course is taught from an interdisciplinary perspective with the assumption that students understand and can apply the scientific method and their knowledge in general biology, basic inorganic and organic chemistry and math to master essential genetics concepts through problem solving and data analysis (refer to assignments below). Students who take this course will demonstrate:
· Comprehension of concepts by applying concepts to solving general and challenging problems in transmission and molecular genetics.
· Building of conceptual knowledge through integration of previously learned concepts to solving new and more difficult problems as well as in participation in class discussions.
· Mastery of concepts by earning 100% on quizzes (refer to syllabus).
· Knowledge of material and understanding of concepts by passing exams covering specified material (refer to syllabus).
· Ability to present knowledge orally by presenting a well-researched, concept integrated PowerPoint-assisted oral presentation on a specific cancer genetic topic (refer to Chapter 23).

Academic Integrity/Academic Honesty Policy As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty," and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at http://www.uga.edu/honesty. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to

course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor. All violations

of the Honor Code will be referred to the Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs' office. Cheating on any

academic endeavor in this class will result in a grade of "0" for the specific task.

Disability Accommodation Statement

(For Griffin Campus)

If you have a disability and require classroom accommodations, you must see me immediately after the

first class or make an appointment to see me during my office hours. If you plan to request

accommodations for a disability, please register with the Disability Resource Center through the

Office of Student Affairs, 105 Flynt Building, and 770-229-3464.

Attendance

·

Mandatory. Students are expected to attend and participate in all class sessions.

·

No cell phones or cell phones must be turned off during class.

Homework

·

Students are expected to have completed homework prior to coming to class.

·

Assigned quizzes on homework require mastery (refer to Quizzes). They are always assigned

for homework after class on Wednesday and must be completed by 7 AM the following Monday.

Exams

1. One-hour long, scheduled in the syllabus and taken online Griffin SLC 204 & Tifton

Classroom

2. Covers mostly new material. Since understanding genetics concepts is based on cumulative

knowledge, there will always be material from previous tests.

3. Oral presentation (Chapter 23: Cancer Genetics) will count as a single Exam grade. The graded

is based on: presentation (80%) + references (20% ) (refer to Course Descriptions and Learning

Outcomes) = 100%. This presentation will be:

· 10 minutes, eight minutes for the presentation and two minutes for questions.

· graded according to the rubric in the syllabus and count as an exam grade.

· the result of a focused literature review based on at least 10 recent refereed journal articles,

· references written according to style accepted by the journal Molecular Phylogenetics and

Evolution

· approved by the Professor and all students must schedule at least one session with Dr.

Jenkins to go over content of talk.

4. The Final Exam is comprehensive and counts 25% of the grade.

5. With a doctor's excuse, a student may make-up one missed exam, which, although covering the

same material will be different from the exam given to students at the allotted time.

Quizzes

1. Purpose: To assess each student's acquisition and understanding of core research methods,

facts and concepts. Thus all students must master a core set of knowledge gained through

reading the required textbook chapters, reviewing lecture and other PowerPoints on eLearning,

viewing video presentations from Khan Academy and other sources, and working required

homework problems.

· Mastery is defined as attaining a score of 100% correct on assigned quizzes. No credit

<100% will be given. But you may take each quiz as many times as you want from the

time the quiz is made available on a Wednesday at 11 AM until 7:00 AM the day of class

on the following Monday (see syllabus) when access to the quiz will no longer be

available.

· Quiz grades are, therefore, either 100% or 0

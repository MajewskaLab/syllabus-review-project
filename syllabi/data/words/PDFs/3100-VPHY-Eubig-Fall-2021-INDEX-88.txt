Reference Textbook: Human Physiology (16th ed., 2022), Stuart I. Fox, McGraw-Hill Education https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/human-physiology-foxrompolski/M9781260720464.html This is also available through the university bookstore. This text is not required but you will do better in the course if you read it consistently.
Required Application: Top Hat (a classroom response system, Join Code: 689905)
The direct link to the course: https://app.tophat.com/e/689905 We use this system for checking attendance and for pop quizzes. Refer to the Top Hat module on eLC for details.

Office Hours:
Instructors will be available after class to answer questions. (Dr. Eubig has limited time on Mondays.) If more lengthy questions or sensitive topics need to be discussed, please contact the instructor to arrange a meeting.
Before each exam there will be an online (Zoom) question-based review session during which you are invited to bring your questions about the unit for discussion. The questions and discussions during office hours will contribute to your understanding of the course. Each instructor will announce when the session will take place. Each session will be recorded and posted for those unable to attend.
Zoom meeting links for instructors: Please log in through https://uga.zoom.us . More complete zoom links are posted in the document "Complete invitations for Zoom meetings".

Grading Guidelines:
Examinations and Bonus Points - Examinations will be based on assignments from the instructional Power Point slides, information presented in class, and the textbook.
The course includes 4 major units. An in-class examination will be given after the conclusion of each major unit (Sept. 13, Oct. 6, Nov. 8). Exam 4 (Dec. 10, 12:00-1:00 PM) is during finals and is NOT a comprehensive examination. Each exam is typically 40 multiple choice questions in 50 minutes (60 for exam 4). Bring No. 2 pencils and a calculator to each exam. Please arrive early for each exam so that you may begin promptly at 1:50 PM. Info on exams is found in the "About VPHY 3100" presentation under Content in eLC.
There will be unannounced quizzes and attendance checks throughout the semester. These will be administered through Top Hat. You must be present to participate. The score for a typical quiz will include 0.5 to 1 point for attendance and 0.5 to 1 point for correctly answering the question(s). Points earned are bonus points.
The grade for each of the 4 units will be computed based upon the examination grade with bonus points added up to a maximum of 100 points for the unit. Please do not ask for points above 100 to be applied to other units' scores.
Course Grade - The final grade for the course is calculated based on 400 points, 100 points for each unit. Final grades are not rounded up, unless you present a rain check as discussed in the "About VPHY 3100" presentation.
Assignment of the final letter grade is based on the following guidelines:
93 to 100% A, 90 to < 93% A87 to < 90% B+, 83 to < 87% B, 80 to < 83% B77 to < 80% C+, 73 to < 77% C, 70 to < 73% C60 to < 70% D Below 60% F
Absence from an Exam: As soon as you think there is a possibility you might miss an exam, please contact the instructor for that unit. An unexcused absence from an examination will be recorded as 0. A student with an excused absence from an exam will be retested with special arrangement by the instructor. Per the General Academic Regulations of UGA, the decision to excuse an absence, allow make-up work, or reschedule or make up an exam is entirely at the discretion of each faculty member or instructor.
Grade Dispute: Students with questions/disputes about quiz, exam or final grades must appeal the issue within one week after posting of the grade. This timeline is much shorter with the final exam - 24 hours - because grades need to be submitted soon after the final.
Tutoring: The Division of Academic Enhancement offers peer-tutoring for VPHY 3100. There are peer tutors ready to help you learn. I would not wait until the first exam to decide you need tutoring. If you have the slightest notion that you might need some assistance in understanding the topics in this class, either check out their website

https://dae.uga.edu/services/tutoring/appointment_tutoring/ or "How to Schedule a Tutoring Appointment" under course info.
Accommodations: The exams are fast-paced. If you have an accommodation or have been considering getting diagnosed to receive one, start that process today to get registered through the Disability Resource Center before the first exam. You do not want to wait until you do poorly on the first exam.
If you have a health problem that might lead to you missing an exam or other component of the course, strongly consider obtaining a disability-related absence accommodation though DRC. This will reduce stress related to the course if you have an unanticipated absence.
Contact Dr. Eubig if you have accommodation-related issues.
Academic Honesty: All academic work must meet the standards contained in "A Culture of Honesty." Each student is responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work. Signing in another student's attendance or taking a quiz for another student via Top Hat are examples of academic dishonesty.
The University of Georgia's honor code, "A Culture of Honesty," can be found online at: https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/Introduction/
Honors Papers: Please refer to the introductory course information in eLC.
The course syllabus is a general plan for the course. Changes announced in class and/or eLC by the instructor may be necessary.

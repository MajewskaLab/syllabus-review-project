You will work and together you will write a report and present the research article at the end of the semester on
Select any article meeting the following criteria:
1) Research article (not review articles) must be published in the top tier journals of Nature, Science, Cell, Journal of Cell Biology, Molecular Biology of the Cell or Molecular Cell.
2) Article selection is due by midterm March 3, 2011. Email article copy to me by this date so that I may post the article on eLearning Commons for reading. Clear reasoning, concise writing, and your own judgments are required for this analysis. Article selection on deadline is 2% grade. The following questions may guide your thinking:
 Is the problem significant?  Are the approaches suited to answering the question posed?  Are the experiments well designed and presented?  Are important control experiments performed?  Do the results of the paper support the conclusions stated?

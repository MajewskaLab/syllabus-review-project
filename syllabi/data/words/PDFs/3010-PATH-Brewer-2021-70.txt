A missed exam due to illness, death in the family, graduate school visit, intramural sports, extracurricular activities, job interview, or any other reason will count as the dropped exam. There will be no make-up exams. You must contact me immediately if there are extenuating circumstances causing you to miss more than one exam. Attendance, participation (50 pts): There will be in-class participation activities throughout the semester conducted with TopHat. There will be numerous opportunities to earn these points, so you can miss some activities (~3-4 classes) without it affecting your participation grade. There will be no make-up participation activities. You must contact me immediately if there are extenuating circumstances where you miss participation credit in more than 4 classes. Quizzes, assignments (50 pts): There will be six quizzes and small assignments throughout the semester. These will be announced. Most will be conducted via eLC. These must be completed by the due date. You will be given at least 1 week to complete these assignments or quizzes. One of these will be waived or dropped. There will be no make-up quizzes or assignments. Academic honesty: I expect all students to follow the UGA honor code. Any cheating, unauthorized assistance or use of materials, or other academic dishonesty will be reported to the Office of the Vice President of Instruction for action. "I will be academically honest in all of my work and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others." UGA Student Honor Code

Exams

Course Components

You will take five exams during the semester worth 50 points each. Each exam will be composed of multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, short answer, and labeling questions that cover specified textbook chapters, lectures, and class discussions.

After the first person has completed the exam, I will still hand out exams to those who arrive past that point, but the exam can only be completed for 75% of the total points. Arrive on time!

It is your responsibility to contact me if you miss an exam. Make-up exams will only occur with validated excuses (i.e.. Doctor's note, athletic form, etc.).

Science Communication Reflections (SCR)
Before we cover each chapter, you will submit a reflection of a related science communication method (TED Talks, Podcasts, and News Articles) via the appropriate drop box on eLC. Links to the relevant materials for each SCR can be found by clicking this link. There will be 15 reflections worth 2 points each that will be due over the course of the semester. Your reflection will be guided by the template posted on eLC. Each reflection should be written in complete sentences. Science Communication Reflections are due by 11:59 pm of the due date listed on both eLC and the course schedule and should be uploaded as a word document or PDF.

In-Class Activities
Throughout the semester there will be activities that relate to the course material being covered. These activities will range from group discussions, minute papers, and more. I will use these activities to both deepen and assess learning of course content. The in-class activities will have a completion grade and will have feedback given if necessary.
Science Communication Assignment
For this assignment you will create a way to communicate findings on some aspect of brain functioning that is of interest to you. The topic you choose can be almost anything related to neuroscience. I want you to learn something new, integrate information from peer-reviewed journal articles, and effectively communicate what is known about your chosen topic. The format in which you communicate your findings is also left up to your personal preference. Further instructions and a rubric for this assignment can be found on eLC, so make sure to refer to that when completing this assignment. I've listed potential ideas for how to communicate information below.
Potential Formats:
 Video - Create a 3-5 minute video that communicates your chosen topic. This could mimic a news story, TED Talk, TED-Ed, or Crash Course video.
 Write a Feature News Article - Write an article comparable to what you would find in a newspaper/magazine/online source. Articles should be at least 750 words long and formatted like a news article.
 Other - Have another idea for how to creatively and effectively communicate science? Feel free to run ideas by me, and we can work out the details.

Extra Credit Research Activity
This portion of the course will allow you to learn more about areas of psychology that are of personal interest to you and learn more about the psychological research process along the way. There are two options to receive extra credit. Any combination of two (2 talks, 2 articles, or 1 talk and 1 article) of the following may be used to receive up to 10 points of extra credit on your final grade:
1) Attending and reflecting on psychology-related talks. Numerous psychology-related talks occur each semester on campus. When talks become known to me, I will bring them up in class, and post them to eLC. In order to receive full credit, students must attend talks and then write up a reflection on the talk. The template for talk reflections can be found on eLC, and further instructions can be found on the template. Students will receive 5 bonus points for each talk attended not to exceed 10 total points (i.e., Attending two talks, and writing two reflections). All summaries should be turned in to their designated Dropbox on eLC by 11:59 pm of the due date listed on eLC and uploaded as a word document or PDF.
2) Reading and summarizing articles. If you want to become more involved in psychological research, you need to be able to decipher a research article. In order to receive full credit, students must read a peer-reviewed article from research journals in psychology that cover a concept in neuroscience and write an article summary. The template for article summaries can be found on eLC, and further instructions can be found on the template. Students will receive 5 bonus points per article not to exceed 10 points (i.e., reading and summarizing two more articles). All summaries should be turned in to their designated Dropbox on eLC by 11:59 pm of the due date listed on eLC and uploaded as a word document or PDF.
Course Policies
Attendance
Attendance will not be taken or graded in this class. I highly encourage everyone to attend every class session. Students who attend class regularly tend to perform better in the course compared to their nonattending classmates (Bowman, 2009). If significant amounts of students are not in attendance, there may be extra credit points given, but this will be at my discretion. If you miss a class, please be sure to get notes from your peers. You do not need to inform me if you are going to miss a class, unless it is an exam day.
Tardiness will only hinder your ability to meet course objectives. If you arrive late, you will be responsible for obtaining any information that has already been presented, and you should enter the room with as little distraction as possible. Be responsible and arrive on time.
Electronics
If you want to use a laptop/desktop/tablet to take notes, please sit towards the back of the classroom so you do not distract other students. Sana, Weston, and Cepeda (2013) found that computers serve as distractions for the user AND others around them. In fact, research has shown that those who take notes by hand perform better on tests than those who take notes on a laptop/desktop/tablet (Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014). In the same vein, if you don't want to be distracted sit up closer to the front.
Cell phones should remain out of sight. If you need to use your phone for whatever reason, please quietly leave the room.

University Honor Code and Academic Honesty Policy
UGA Student Honor Code: "I will be academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others."
A Culture of Honesty, the University's policy and procedures for handling cases of suspected dishonesty, can be found at www.uga.edu/ovpi.
My policy is to give a score of 0% on any assignment completed through academic dishonesty (cheating, plagiarism, etc.).
Disability Statement
If you plan to request accommodations for a disability, please register with the Disability Resource Center at 114 Clark Howell Hall, 706-706)542-8719 (voice), (706)542-8778 (tty), http://drc.uga.edu/contact_request.php
Civility
Students are expected to communicate in a civil manner in academic interactions at all times, both in and out of the classroom. This means that interactions are to be carried out in a courteous, and dignified manner that are respectful and understanding toward peers, professors, and staff. Failure to behave in a civil manner may result in disciplinary actions as described by the Student Conduct Code.
Late Work
Work should be submitted by the assigned due date. If for any reason you cannot submit your work by the assigned due date, then you can still submit work with a penalty. For each 24-hour period that work is late, I will deduct 10% from the grade of the assignment. This does not include exams or in-class activities. This policy is only for Science Communication Reflections, the Science Communication Assignment, and Extra Credit Research Activity.
Disputing Grades
To dispute a grade, you must contact me no later than one week after you have received the grade for the assignment. If you would like clarification or to ask questions, feel free to send me an email to make an appointment!
In terms of final grades, I will not round overall grades. The points you earn are your final grade, regardless of how close you come to the next letter grade. Besides what is already built into the course, there will be no extra credit given. This is out of fairness for all students.
Giving Grades of Incomplete
A grade of incomplete is only assigned in extremely unusual circumstances. Such situations require extensive documentation and approval of faculty supervisors. It is only an option if a student is passing the class and is typically only awarded when a student has completed the majority of the classwork and is only missing one or two exams or assignments. If a grade of incomplete is approved, a written plan for completion of the coursework must be developed by the instructor and student and approved by the faculty supervisor.

ECOL 4000/6000 Population and Community Ecology Fall 2022
Time: Tu Th 2.20 - 3.35 pm. (3 credit hours) Place: Science Learning Center, Room 345
Instructors: John Drake, Ph.D. & Andrew Park, Ph.D. Email: jdrake@uga.edu, awpark@uga.edu
Office hours: By appointment
Overview Population and community ecology are active fields of research with important applications for management and conservation. This course links conceptual issues and basic models with data and field approaches relevant for understanding population and community dynamics in time and space. Approximately, the first third of the course focuses on the birth, death, and movement of organisms, with particular reference to the population dynamics of single-species; the middle third of the course focuses on interactions among species, including competition and predation; and the final third of the course focuses on the causes and consequences of biodiversity (the co-occurrence of multiple species).
Format The course format includes lectures, readings, quizzes, demonstrations, exercises, discussions, group activities and homework assignments. Throughout the semester, students will work on group projects, with several class periods dedicated to group project development and data analysis.
Text Pre-recorded lecture videos and readings will be uploaded to the course eLC page approximately one week before they are due to be watched/read, along with occasional readings from the primary literature. Watching & reading of posted material prior to the scheduled time is essential. Short quizzes will be given on eLC based on their content and will be due by the beginning of class.
Group work Students will be assigned to small groups and will work together through the semester developing and answering research questions related to the population and community ecology of natural systems. Students will work with real data sets and, in consultation with instructors, will develop a presentation, given to the class towards the end of the semester.
Prerequisites This course assumes you are familiar with general ecology and biology, and have taken ECOL 3500.
Attendance (please also see final page for more coronavirus information) It is important that students keep pace with the material in class. We have developed the class to maximize the value of in-person class time. Pre-recorded lectures and posted readings give students

enhanced flexibility about how to organize their time. In person classroom sessions will be active, including discussions, Q&A, worked examples, in-class homework and project development. If a student is unable to attend a classroom session, we ask that they check in with instructors as soon as possible thereafter (beginning with an email) so that they catch up with material. They should also check in with their project group.

Evaluation Short quizzes will be taken whenever there is at-home preparation (recorded lectures/readings). Students can take each quiz twice, and may keep the better of their two scores. Additionally, there will be 15 homework assignments (one per topic on the syllabus). In most cases, students will be able to start (or in some cases, even finish) homeworks in class, and instructors will be available to help students work through more challenging questions. Homeworks will typically be due one week after they are assigned. There will be two exams during class periods (September 22nd & October 27th) and a final exam on December 13th (3:30-6:30pm). Exams are non-cumulative and will be taken in class. Questions will include a mix of True/False, Multiple Choice, and Short Answer.

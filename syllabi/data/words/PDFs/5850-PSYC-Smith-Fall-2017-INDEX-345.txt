I reserve the right to change anything on the syllabus and schedule as needed, but I will notify you of any changes.

Objectives: Upon successful completion of the course, students should achieve the following objectives:

Content-Related Course Objectives

1. Understand the basic principles of pharmacology, including pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 2. Know basic neuroanatomy & neurophysiology 3. Know the major neurotransmitter systems 4. Understand and be able to discuss how neurotransmission underlies behavior 5. Be familiar with various tools used in neuroscience and pharmacology research 6. Know the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of commonly abused drugs 7. Know the neurological underpinnings of and pharmacological treatments for central nervous system disorders

Skill-Related Course Objectives

8. Be able to apply course information to understand how any psychoactive drug may effect neurotransmission, and thereby effect behavior 9. Be able to apply course information to understand the neurobiological bases of any central nervous system disorder 10. Be able to design pharmacological and behavioral neuroscience experiments 11. Be able to read and critically evaluate basic research literature in psychopharmacology 12. Improve scientific writing ability

Attendance Policy:
Attendance is not required; however, you may not make up any work that you miss due to an absence or tardiness. Exceptions are as follows: 1. You may make up Exam 1 and Exam 2 if the following criteria are met a. You must notify me ahead of time with a legitimate excuse and documentation b. I must approve your reason before class 2. Assignments that are supposed to be submitted via ELC will still be accepted regardless of absence
Academic Honesty Policy:
All academic work must meet the University's standards contained in "A Culture of Honesty" found in your student handbooks and which may be accessed online at the following URL: http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahpd/culture_honesty.htm. Students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work. Academic dishonesty of any kind (e.g., plagiarism, cheating, turning in work submitted for credit in another course etc.) will not be tolerated! Infractions will be reported to the OVPI and the student will receive at least a zero on the assignment.

Assessment:
Final grades will be calculated by a total points method. The total points you earned will be divided by the total possible points and multiplied by 100 to calculate your final percentage. Normal rounding rules will be applied. You will receive the corresponding letter grade, as outlined in the table to the right.
A grade of incomplete is only assigned in extremely unusual circumstances. Such situations require extensive documentation and approval of faculty supervisors. It is only an option if a student is passing the class and is typically only awarded when a student has completed the majority of the classwork and is only missing one or two exams or assignments. If a grade of incomplete is approved, a written plan for completion of the coursework must be developed by the instructor and student and approved by the faculty supervisor.
A summary of planned assessments are outlined below.

Final % 94  X  100 90  X  93 88  X  89 83  X  87 80  X  82 78  X  79 73  X  77 70  X  72 65  X  69

ELC Quizzes:
Chapter quizzes will be available on ELC for the assigned readings. The purpose of these assessments is to encourage you to comlete the readings before class and for you to gauge your own understanding of course material. These quizzes are not required; however, you may particiapte in the extra credit opportunity outlined below.
 You must complete 17/20 quizzes over the course of the semester  Each quiz must be completed before the class period the reading was assigned for, unless otherwise specified
o Access to quizzes will remain open throughout the semester  You must score 80% or better  Completion of this extra credit opportunity is worth 15 points
o Example: If you earned 350/499 points by the end of the semester you would get a 70.1% or a C-, if you completed the extra credit, you would earn 365/499 points and get a 73/1%, which is a C.
Technology:
Cell Phones Please silence all cell phones before class begins and do not talk on cell phones or text during class. Leave the room to make or receive phone calls, obviously. There are no penalties for texting during class, as there shouldn't have to be. Just don't do it.
Computers You may use laptops to take notes. Research indicates that students sitting near other students who are off-task on computers tend to perform worse in the class, as it is incredibly distracting. Therefore, if you are reported for or caught being off-task on your computers during class, you will receive half of a letter grade deduction. For example, if you had a B, you will receive a B-. It is important that you respect me and your peers. If you don't want to pay attention in class, just don't come.

Students with disabilities:
If you plan to request accommodations for a disability, please see me after class/make an appointment and register with the Disability Resource Center at 114 Clark Howell Hall, (706)542-8719 (voice), (706)542-8778 (tty), http://drc.uga.edu/contact_request.php.

Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes:  Be conversant about the role of aquaculture in meeting global food demand and issues of sustainability.  Understand basic life support needs for aquatic organisms and be familiar with various ways those needs are met in aquaculture  Be familiar with the role of water quality and how different types of aquaculture systems are able to maintain sufficient water quality for aquatic animals.  Have a basic understanding of genetics, stress, aquatic animal health, and common diseases of aquatic animals.  Gain practical experience with culture of aquatic animals.  Develop skills for oral presentations, writing, problem-solving and decision-making required for successful culture of various aquatic species.

Exams: There will be three exams. Exams will be a combination of T/F, multiple choice, fill in the blank, short answer and essay.
Aquaculture Reference Manual: Each student will compile an Aquaculture Reference Manual throughout the semester. Materials will include SRAC documents, research articles and other materials as appropriate. Additional information will be provided in a separate handout.
Scientific Paper Reviews: Each student will prepare two reviews of recently research papers that deal with some aspect of sustainable aquaculture. These articles and reviews will be included in the Aquaculture Reference Manual. Additional information will be provided in a separate handout.
Individual Presentation: Each student will select a species and present a 15 min presentation on aquaculture approaches for that species, including environmental effects and alternatives for more sustainable culture. Presentation dates are April 3, 5, 10. More information will be provided in a separate handout.
Group Presentation: Students will form groups of 2-3 and will present an in-depth look at an issue central to the sustainability of aquaculture. Groups should objectively discuss the issue before giving their personal opinions on the matter. Each student in the group must give part of the presentation, which will last approx. 25 min + 5 min for questions/discussion. Presentations will be Feb 22, 27, and March 1.
Graduate Credit (FISH 6550): In addition to the coursework required for FISH 4550, graduate students are required to explore a recent development to increase the sustainability of aquaculture. A topic must be approved in writing by February 1 and a detailed outline is due by March 1. Graduate students will give a 25 min (20 min + 5 min for questions) powerpoint presentation about their topic to the class on March 29. The student is expected to be able to answer questions on the topic (i.e., read beyond the paper). Additional materials will be provided regarding the paper and presentation.
Attendance: Lecture attendance is expected and lab attendance is mandatory. If you miss a meeting, handouts may be obtained from eLC. Attendance is necessary for participation so excessive absences will result in deductions from the `Participation' grade. Attendance is mandatory on all student presentation days and questions for presenters will be noted and rewarded.
Participation: Active involvement in the class is expected. This means attending lectures and labs, being on-time, participating in class discussions, asking questions in class and being prepared to discuss content of lectures, lab activities, field trips and assigned readings.
Lab: Laboratory participation is essential for this course. Active learning to reinforce topics covered in lecture will involve individual activities, group projects, field trips and demonstrations. Most labs are held at Whitehall Forest (ABEL building) so students will need to arrange for transportation. Some lab activities may be off-campus and field trips may require an entire day so students will need to make arrangements for missing other obligations; dates for those trips will be finalized ASAP. Additionally, students will be responsible for culture duties outside of normal lab times. The lab schedule and activity information will be provided in lab and on eLC.

Late and Make-up Policy: Absences from exams or other graded work must be arranged in advance and only for serious reasons. Re-writes for an un-notified absence from an exam will only be considered when there is an extreme and documented emergency and will be dealt with on a case by case basis. It is generally not possible to make up labs because of the prep time and because several labs are field trips that cannot be repeated. Late assignments will be penalized 10% per day and after one week will not be accepted (i.e., assigned a grade of zero).
University Honor Code and Academic Honesty Policy: All academic work must meet the standards contained in "A Culture of Honesty." Students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work. The link to more detailed information about academic honesty can be found at: http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahpd/culture_honesty.htm
Students with Disabilities: Students with disabilities who require reasonable accommodations in order to participate in course activities or meet course requirements should contact the instructor within the first week of the semester so that suitable arrangements can be made.
NOTE: The syllabus and activity schedules are a general plan for the course; deviations may be necessary and will be announced to the class by the instructors and posted on eLC.

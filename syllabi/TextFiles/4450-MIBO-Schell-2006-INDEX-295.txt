IDIS(MIBO) 4450/6450-4450L/6450L MICROBIAL GENETICS: 4 Credit Hours (Microbial Genetics and Genomics)
Course Description: Molecular basis of gene regulation in microorganisms with emphasis on systems pertaining to pathogenesis, evolution, and ecology. Computer lab examines evolutionary relatedness, sequence comparisons, database searches and reconstruction of metabolic pathways.
Expected Learning Outcomes: Students will develop an understanding of bacterial genetic systems and how they relate to important bacterial processes. Students will also develop an understanding for genomic and proteonomic approaches for studying diverse microbial species.

Additional Requirements for Graduate Students: Graduate students must write a term paper pertaining to topic(s) covered in class.

No excused absences from 1abs. Each missed lab results in loss of 50 pts from final grade.

Grades: A-F

Honor Code and Academic Honesty Policy As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty", and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: www.uga.edu/honesty <http://www.uga.edu/honesty>. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to the course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.

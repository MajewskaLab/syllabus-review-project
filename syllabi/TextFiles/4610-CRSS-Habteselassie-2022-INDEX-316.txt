Course Syllabus for SOIL MICROBIOLOGY CRSS (MIBO) 4610/6610
FALL 2022
The course objective is to familiarize the students with the basic concepts of soil microbiology, including introduction to the major soil microbial communities, their function and role in the environment and methods for their detection and characterization. At the end of the course, students are expected to know the major groups of microorganisms, the service they provide in environment from environmental and agronomic perspectives and techniques for studying them and their function in soil.

Missing exams and laboratory reports: No make-ups exams will be given without prior permission from the instructor or medical reasons. Late lab handins/reports are subject to point deductions and will not be accepted three days after the deadline unless one has a good reason.
Attendance: Everyone is expected to attend; see course requirements section for attendance points.
Academic honesty: All academic work must meet the standards contained in "A culture of Honesty."http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahpd/culture_honesty.htm. Students are responsible to inform themselves about those standards before performing any academic work.
Disability: If you have a disability and require classroom accommodations, please see me after class or make an appointment during office hours. If you plan to request accommodations for a disability, please register with the Disability Resources Center through the Office of Student Affairs.

COVID-19 Note: The University System of Georgia encourages everyone--whether vaccinated or not--to wear a face covering while inside campus facilities. However, face coverings and social distancing are not required.

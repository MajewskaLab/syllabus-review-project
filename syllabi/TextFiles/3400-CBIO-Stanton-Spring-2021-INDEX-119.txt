 You may see your scores at any time on eLC: https://uga.view.usg.edu/  Overall course grades will be assigned using the following scale: A grades (100-90), B grades (8980), C grades (79-70), D grades (69-60), and <60 F. We will use + and - for grades. The instructors
may decide to curve overall course grades, but only to give higher grades than what this scale allows.

Homework Assignments and Lecture Writing Exercises (48 points)  General Information: To encourage your ongoing engagement in learning, you will have the
opportunity to earn points by completing homework assignments and lecture writing exercises.  Homework: Homework assignments will be submitted using the "Assignment" function in eLC.
There will be one homework assignment for each of the four sections of the course. Due dates for
these assignments will be shared at the start of each section.  Late Assignments: Homework will be accepted up to 24 hours after the due date for a 50%
penalty. For example, if you earn 6/7 on an assignment submitted 5 minutes late, your score will be
3/7. After 24 hours after the due date, assignments will not be accepted.  Lecture Writing Exercises: Questions will be designed to give you practice writing about cell
biology. Links for submitting your answers will be shared in the Zoom Chat during lectures. There are
no makeups for lecture writing exercises.

Breakout Sessions (72 points, top nine 8-point breakout sessions count)  General Information: Breakout sessions are an opportunity for students to collaborate in groups,
practice problem solving, review difficult concepts, discuss primary literature, and engage in other
learning activities.  Format: Breakout sessions will take place through synchronous Zoom meetings. We will send you
an invitation to register for a Zoom meeting corresponding to the section you are enrolled in.  Students will earn up to 72 points by actively engaging in breakout sessions. Each breakout session
on a topic (see numbered topics schedule) is worth 8 points. The journal club will start with a short quiz. Your participation is required for the full duration of the breakout session to earn points.  Flexibility: There will be eleven breakout sessions on a topic, so if an emergency arises, two of
these could be missed without loss of points.  Additional expectation: We expect you to attend breakout from a location that will allow you and
your group members to focus. Please use one of your two emergency absences if you do not find
yourself in a location suitable for learning during your scheduled breakout session time.

Exams (75 points each)  General information: Exams will focus on concepts and mechanisms explored in lecture and
breakout sessions. You will be asked to synthesize, apply, and evaluate cell biology information.  Format: Exams will be 75-minutes long and open-book/open-note. They will be submitted using the
Assignment function in eLC. Exams will include long answer and short essay questions.  Rules: You can use the internet, but other people cannot be used as resource. This means you
cannot consult with another person in any way (e.g., not in person, not by phone/video/text, and not in
writing). You must ensure your answers are in your own words and your own style of writing.  Make-up Exams: Special arrangements must be made in advance by email, if a university-
approved absence will prevent you from taking one of the exams during the scheduled date and time.

Other Information
Academic Honesty  It is expected that all students in this course will work in accordance with University of Georgia guidelines regarding academic honesty, and the Student Honor Code: "I will be academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others." Issues related to academic honesty will be handled strictly according to policies and procedures available at: https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/

 Violations include (but are not limited to), cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized assistance, lying, or tampering with files. All evidence of violations will be reported to Academic Honesty.  The Honor Code states that students are required to report violations by other students.
Students with Disabilities  Accommodations are available for students with disabilities. If you plan to request accommodations, please register with the Disability Resource Center. They can be reached by calling 706-542-8719 (voice) or 706-542-8778 (TTY), or by visiting http://drc.uga.edu.  As instructors, we fully support your use of accommodations in this class. If you are a student with a disability you are invited, but not required, to email Dr. Stanton to schedule a time to communicate about how we can best support your learning in this course.
Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy  The University's Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy states: "The University of Georgia (the "University") is committed to maintaining a fair and respectful environment for living, work, and study. To that end, and in accordance with federal and state law, University System of Georgia ("USG") policy, and University policy, the University prohibits harassment of or discrimination against any person because of race, color, sex (including sexual harassment and pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity or national origin, religion, age, genetic information, disability, or veteran status by any member of the University Community (as defined below) on campus, in connection with a University program or activity, or in a manner that creates a hostile environment for any member of the University Community. Incidents of harassment and discrimination will be met with appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal or expulsion from the University." See https://eoo.uga.edu/policies-resources/ndah-policy/ for additional information.  If you would like to talk with an ombudsperson about a potential violation of this policy, please visit https://eoo.uga.edu/policies-resources/the-ombudspersons/meet-the-ombudspersons/. You are also invited, but not required, to email Dr. Stanton to schedule a time to discuss incidents that might arise in CBIO3400.
Learning in Spring 2021
We believe that every student can learn new concepts, develop new skills, and be successful in Cell Biology. We recognize that learning during a pandemic involves new challenges. We also know that you are bright and motivated students who can succeed in this course.
All members of our class will learn new concepts and develop new skills this semester. Actively engaging in lecture and breakout session is one of the best ways to do this. With all that is going on, it might be tempting to log on to Zoom and zone out. We encourage you to stay engaged in lecture and breakout sessions, and we will do our part to try to help you do that! We have found that active engagement in lecture and breakout sessions is critical for success in Cell Biology.
This semester will be unlike most semesters we've experienced as students and instructors because we will be teaching and learning online. If any problems arise related to Cell Biology, please reach out to us by email so we can try to work together to find solutions. We care about you as a student and we want to support your learning this semester.
Best wishes, Dr. Stanton & Dr. Etheridge

EXAMS AND GRADING: There will be four exams (worth 100 points each), at the times noted on the attached schedule. The final exam is the fourth regular exam and is not cumulative.

As announced in the Spring 2007 Schedule, the final examination is scheduled for May 1 from 3:30 - 6:30 p.m.

For all four exams the following grades are guaranteed: 70-76 C; 77-79 C+; 80-82 B-; 83-86 B; 87-89 B+; 90-92 A-; 93-100 A. In computing final grades, adjustments to extend letter grades to lower numerical ranges may be made on a class-wide basis at the discretion of the faculty. Incomplete grades will not be given unless there is a compelling medical or personal issue that prevents the completion of the course.

Make-up exams will only be given if students have obtained permission to miss the exam in advance from the professor that is giving the exam; this will require a compelling reason that must be documented.

Issues related to academic honesty will be dealt with according to the guidelines and procedures described in the booklet: "A Culture of Honesty: Policies and Procedures on Academic Honesty".

STUDY SUPPORT: Lecturers will make study guides available to you through WebCT covering their respective topics. These may include PowerPoint files, reading assignments, and study questions.

You are invited to speak with the lecturers either briefly after class or during their office hours. The TA is also available if you would like to obtain personal help with subject matter. If the scheduled office hours are not convenient then you may arrange another time. Administrative matters should be addressed to the faculty who is currently teaching. We encourage you to ask questions during the lectures.

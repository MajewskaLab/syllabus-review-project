Room 404D Biological Sciences

Instructors: Dr. Vincent Starai 149 Riverbend Research South (706) 542-5755 vjstarai@uga.edu

Dr. William Whitman whitman@uga.edu
Dr. Eric Stabb estabb@uga.edu

Office Hours: Talk to me, or send me an email, and we'll get something set up!

Required Text: Prescott's Microbiology, 8th ed. by Willey et al., McGraw Hill College Publishing.

Supplements: Information will be presented from outside the required text, and will be provided on eLC., either separately, or contained within the lecture slides.

This course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.

Academic Honesty: As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty", and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: www.uga.edu/honesty. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to the course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.

A website for more detailed information about academic honesty can be found at: http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahpd/ahpd.html

Exams: There will be six exams for this class, including the non-cumulative final (May 4th, 2010 at noon). The lowest exam score will be dropped, and the remaining five exams will be averaged for your final grade. Due to this policy, no make-up exams will be scheduled. All exams will be weighted equally, and will consist of a mixture of short answer, picture-drawing (!), and multiple choice. Previous exams will not be passed out as study guides (because they don't exist yet!).

Scientific Papers: This semester, we will be reading research papers from the primary literature. Two papers -- with topics relevant to the current classroom study -- will be assigned over the course of the semester. You will be asked to read the paper, and we will devote one classroom day identifying the hypotheses, deconstructing the figures, and analyzing the data. You will encounter exam questions that test your comprehension of the paper.

eLC use: Slides used for each lecture will try to be placed on eLC after each lecture, by 6pm of the following day. I will do my best to maintain communication in eLC, but if you submit a question to me via eLC, please email me directly - just to remind me. Supplemental notes and texts will be provided here, when necessary.

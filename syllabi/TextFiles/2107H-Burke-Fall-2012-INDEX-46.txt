BLC is a full service computer lab and has a variety of materials you will find helpful,

including videotapes and computers. The BLC is a resource for information related to the

Biology classes you are taking. The BLC has Macintosh and Windows computers and

printers for your use, study tables, and a reference library containing textbooks, lab

manuals, and MCAT, GRE, GMAT, internship and scholarship information.

Texts:

Course text: Biology, Campbell · Reece, 9th edition, 2011, Benjamin/Cummings Laboratory manual: Biology 1107L/2107L: Principals of Biology I
Laboratory Manual. First Edition. Top-perforated 50 set carbonless notebook: This or its equivalent may be
purchased at the campus bookstore and possibly at bookstores off campus. You will need this to turn in lab assignments each week. Supplemental handouts or material given for lecture or laboratory

Lab Coordinator: Kris Miller, 402 Biological Sciences Phone: 542-1681, e-mail krmiller@uga.edu

Laboratory: Starts the week of August 13, 2012 Participation in this course requires concurrent enrollment in both 2107 (lecture) and
2107L (lab) classes. Students who do not enroll in both the lecture and the lab classes or who drop either the lecture or the lab during the drop/add period without permission from the Instructor or the Biology Division will be administratively dropped from the other course as well. Students who withdraw from the course after the drop/add period will be assigned a WP or WF based on completed assignments and class participation up to the time of withdrawal.
You are required to read assigned exercises in the lab manual and any others given to you by your teaching assistant in preparation for lab. Your graduate laboratory assistant instructor (GLA) will either be Sean Durning (sdurn@uga.edu) or Justin Polizzi (jpolizzi@bmb.uga.edu). Their mailboxes will be located in the BLC.
BIOL 2107L is a Writing Intensive Lab Course. It closely follows the guidelines established by the University of Georgia's Writing Intensive Program (WIP). Our goal in following these guidelines is to help you become better writers in your academic field of science, as writing and thinking are parallel cognitive (learning) processes. Writing engages individuals in the information being studied and therefore results in better retention of this subject material.

Safety rule - you must purchase a lab coat and wear it to all labs. Your waist to your toes should also be completely covered.

Lecture Teaching Assistant: The lecture teaching assistant, Sean Durning, is assigned to the course to help in grading exams. Sean will also review material with you and answer questions. e-mail: sdurn@uga.edu

Points Available for Lecture: Exam 1 100 TH 06 Sep 2012 Exam 2 100 TH 04 Oct 2012 Exam 3 100 TU 06 Nov 2012 Exam 4 100 TU 11 Dec 2012 Total 400

Points Required for Letter Grades: A 90% - 100% B 80% - 89% C 70% - 79% D 60% - 69%
Types of Exam Question: Exams will be short and medium length answers, not multiple choice. Some of the questions on each exam will be challenging; as a science major you should learn to think about the material, not just memorize it. You might look at Dr. Darley's study guide for Introductory Biology courses, located at: http://www.plantbio.uga.edu/~darley/studybio.html
Bring IDs to Exams: Bring your ID cards! IDs will be checked at each exam.
Make Up Exams: You may arrange ahead of time to take a makeup exam, provided that you have an acceptable reason (emergency or bereavement) for missing the regularly scheduled exam time. No makeup exams will be arranged after the normal time for an exam has passed, except for emergencies.
Mistakes in Grading: If we make a mistake regarding the grading, please do not be afraid to bring it to our attention; however, asking for additional points on a question will also give the instructors the option of regrading the entire exam.
The cutoff date for corrections to an exam will be one week after the graded exam is returned to the class.
Cheating: Cheating is not permitted. This includes lecture and lab, and covers homework as well as in class or in lab work. Seating at exams will be controlled, and other steps will be taken as necessary to discourage cheating. Unauthorized collaborating in writing lab reports also constitutes a violation of UGA's honor code. See the honor code on line at http://www.uga.edu/honesty/
Withdrawals: Withdrawals with a grade of WP may be made through October 18, 2012

Dr. Mike Arnold C-216B, Life Sciences Building Phone: 542-1407 arnold@plantbio.uga.edu Office Hours: by appointment

2) TEACHING ASSISTANTS Emily Peeden peedener@uga.edu

Mark Fisher mark.aaron.fisher@gmail.com
Becky Shirk rshirk@plantbio.uga.edu

3) CLASS TIME AND LOCATION: 9:30-10:45 Tue/Thu; Room C127, Davison Life Sciences Bldg. In addition, ALL students are required to attend at least one discussion session each week.

4) REQUIRED READING (Available in the University of Georgia Bookstore)
S. Freeman and J. C. Herron. 2007. Evolutionary Analysis J. Weiner. 1995. The Beak of the Finch: A Story of Evolution in Our Time, Vintage Books M. L. Arnold. 2006. Evolution Through Genetic Exchange. Oxford University Press.

5) eLC: You are responsible for checking the eLC course, GENE/BIOL 3000, each day for class outlines, for mail, and for supplementary materials.

6) GRADING SYSTEM 25% of Final Grade: Quizzes and problem sets 25% of Final Grade: Exam I; Tues, Feb. 15 25% of Final Grade: Exam II; Tues, Mar. 29 25% of Final Grade: Final Exam; Tues, May 10, 8-11am

No makeup exams will be given. You must document in writing (e.g., an explanatory note from a physician, NOT a generic note from the Health Center), and sign any excuse for an absence, within a week of the missed exam. Without an excused absence, your grade on a missed exam will be zero. Your highest 10 scores on quizzes and problem sets will be counted. If you miss a quiz, that score is one of the quiz grades you will drop.

7) ACADEMIC HONESTY It is each student's responsibility to be familiar with University policy on academic honesty (read A Culture of Honesty: Policies and Procedures on Academic Honesty). See http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahpd/culture_honesty.htm. Any evidence of academic dishonesty will be turned over to the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs, for consideration and possible action. The minimum penalty for students found guilty of academic dishonesty is a grade of "F" in the course and a note on the student's academic transcript.

8) DISABILITIES The instructors will be happy to accommodate any documented disabilities. Speak to them early in the semester. Contact Disability Services (542-8710) about requesting accommodations.

9) A FEW WORDS TO THE WISE: Get to class on time; don't leave before class ends; turn off cell phones and pagers during class; don't use laptops during lecture except to take notes for the course.

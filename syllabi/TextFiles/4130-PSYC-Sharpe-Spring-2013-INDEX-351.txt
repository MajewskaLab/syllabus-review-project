Course Description & Objectives

WELCOME!

Why study the brain? Weil, without one you wouldn’t be able to ask, much less
answer, that question. At this point in your academic career, you probably have
been told that the brain is the processing center for life. You cannot see, hear,
taste, touch, nor feel without a brain. You cannot speak, experience pain and
pleasure, ask questions, form memories, nor learn new information without a
brain. The brain not only is important for sustaining life, in many ways it IS life
-~ all knowledge of the world and the actions that you perform in it must be
processed by the three pound mass nested safely in your skull, tucked between
your two ears, residing atop the rest of your body.

In this course, you will learn about the neural substrates of human and
nonhuman animal behavior. By the end of the semester, you will be able to
identify many important brain structures, understand the action potential and
other aspects of neurophysiclogy, name many of the hundreds of
neurochemicals that flow through your neural networks, understand some of
the pathways from sensation to perception, and make connections concerning
similarities and differences with regard to neural structures among a wide
variety of animal taxa.

From the Master Syllabus: This course covers the biological bases of human
and nonhuman behavior, with emphasis on underlying physiological
mechanisms, and on the development, evolution, and function of behavior.

By the end of the course students should have learned:

1. Some of the historical, philosophical, and methodological issues
associated with behavioral neuroscience

Some of the methods used in the study of behavioral neuroscience

Some of the fundamentals of neuroscience

Some general and recent knowledge regarding behavioral neuroscience

Some general and recent knowledge regarding study of animal behavior

The laboratory component of this course will provide the student with
in depth exposure to basic neuroanatomy, and comparative animal
behavior and will illustrate principles of sensory processing that

Course Format & Evaluation

This course primarily is lecture-based. The class will be conducted in a
“modular” format, which means that | have grouped together chapters, articles,
and supplementary material that focus on a similar aspect of neuroscience.
Each module builds upon the previous modules, ultimately creating a holistic
framework for you to successfully identify neural substrates of behavior. Upon
completion of each module, you will take an exam* comprised of multiple
choice, short answer, and essay questions.

“Mf you are aware that you will be absent on an exam day, you must notify my ONE WEEK in
advance, and we will arrange for you to take the exam on a different date. If you miss an exam
due to an illness or emergency, | will need documentation such as a doctor’s note, copy of a
speeding ticket, search warrant (kidding}), etc.

Concerning attendance and class participation, there is no formal attendance
policy. This is your education, so feel free to do with it what you see fit. From
personal experience, | can tell you that I’ve always felt better about the work |
did in the courses I showed up to, and | hope you all do well in my class. |
appreciate an email letting me know when you will be absent. | do, however,
monitor your attendance with the use of pop quizzes. The quizzes will be
based on the reading material; | will let you know in advance what | expect you
to read for the quizzes. There will be no make-ups for quizzes.
Thus, the point breakdown(!) and grading scale(!) are as follows:

3 Exams (100 points each) 300 pts.
1 Final Exam (200 points) 200 pts.
10 Pop Quizzes (10 points each) 100 pts.
Total points possible: 600 pts.
553 - 600 A

540 - 552 A

517-539 B+

499-516 B

480 - 498 B-

457 - 479 C+

439 - 456 C

420 - 438 C-

397 - 419 D+

379 - 396 D

360 - 378 D-

359 & below F

If you have a disability and require reasonable classroom accommodations,
please see me after class or make an appointment.

Incomplete Grades

A grade of incomplete is only assigned in extremely unusual circumstances.
Such situations require extensive documentation and approval! of faculty
supervisors. It is only an option if a student is passing the class and is typically
only awarded when a student has completed the majority of the classwork and
is only missing one or two exams or assignments. If a grade of incomplete is
approved, a written plan for completion of the coursework must be developed
by the instructor and student and approved by the faculty supervisor.

Academic Honesty

All academic work must meet the standards contained in "A Culture of Honesty"
(he foveih The UGA Student Honor Code maintains that you
will be academically honest in all of your academic work and will not tolerate
academic dishonesty of others. Students are responsible for informing
themselves about those standards before performing any academic work.
Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy
should be directed to the instructor. Basically, don’t cheat. just don’t do it.

Information:

In addition to assignments from the text, you are responsible for information encompassing lecture notes, handouts, DVDs, additional reading assignments, and class discussions. Therefore, attendance is mandatory if you are to maximize your understanding of principles, concepts, mechanisms, and natural laws that are presented in this course. All academic work must meet the standards contained in "a culture of honesty." Students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work (f.i., Academic Honesty Statement http://www.uga.edu/~vpaa).

It is important to understand that a possible grade for withdrawal both before and after the midpoint of the semester is a WF, which carries the same numerical grade as an F (0 points). A WF will be given 2 school days following the midpoint withdrawal deadline (24 March 2011) to those students who have stopped attending class, failed to take test #2, and consequently are failing the course at that time.

It is your responsibility to make certain that all laboratory assignments are turned in on time, and that you know your grade regarding these assignments. Once the final laboratory grade is turned in to Dr. Barrett, there will be no consideration regarding changing this grade.

COURSE INFORMATION
Description: Lecture, discussions, laboratory sessions, and field trips about the science of ecology mainly focus on the following levels of organization: organism, population, community, ecosystem, landscape, biome, and global.
We will meet for lectures from 9:05-9:55 a.m. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in the auditorium (Room 201) in the Ecology Building.
Lectures: As summarized in the lecture syllabus, a broad range of topics related to the science of ecology will be covered. The lecture material will assume that you have a basic knowledge of general biology (BIOL 1108 is a prerequisite for this course). This course is also to prepare you for more advanced courses in limnology, population and community ecology, behavioral ecology, and ecosystem ecology.
Textbook: The text Fundamentals of Ecology, Fifth Edition, by Eugene P. Odum and Gary W. Barrett can be purchased from the University bookstore or from other local bookstores. You are expected to read the appropriate assigned chapters before each lecture is presented. Additional readings may be used as complementary material for lecture, and will be included in exams.

6

Examinations/Grading: There will be three major tests and a final exam. The final exam (3 hours) is scheduled for 8:00 AM-11:00 AM on Friday, 6 May 2011. Grades will be based on the following criteria:

Test 1 Test 2 Test 3 Lab Final

15% 15% 15% 30% 25%

90 - 100% A 80 - 89% B 70 - 79% C 60 - 69% D
< 60% F

Example: 87% - 89% B+ 83% - 86% B 80% - 82% B-

The final exam will cover material presented in lectures from 10 January through 2 May. (i.e., Final exam will be comprehensive).
Overview comments: I will periodically provide you with the opportunity to receive "Bonus Points." You must follow instructions to receive bonus points. These points will be added to the next scheduled exam. You will not be permitted to do special projects (e.g., term papers) to improve your grade later in the semester. Attend each lecture and laboratory session, understand course material on a daily basis, and you will perform well in the course. We will make a sincere effort to enrich your learning experience.

LABORATORY EXERCISES FOR ECOL/BIOL 3500L
You are required to purchase Ecology Exercise Book: An Ecosystem Approach, Gary W. Barrett, Terry L. Barrett, Scott J. Connelly, Andrew S. Mehring, and James O. Moree.
Laboratory expectations: Actively participate in your assigned laboratory section. We will be providing learning exercises in the laboratory and in the field to deepen your understanding of the science of ecology. Two major objectives are; (1) to provide hands-on-experience to help you connect the real world with the ecological principles that you learn in lecture, and (2) to teach you to communicate your knowledge through writing. Focus will be on data collecting and writing in scientific format.
In order to maximize your experience in this course, full participation in the exercises, including interaction with other students, and instructor is essential. TAs may have unannounced quizzes at the beginning of the sessions to evaluate your familiarity with the exercises scheduled for that day.
Attendance is mandatory. Tardiness is disrespectful of the other students in class. Driving yourself to laboratory sessions, without prior permission, will be considered evidence of tardiness. If you miss a session, you must have a written documentation of your absence in order to make up the session. A valid excuse is one that is written, verifiable, and covers the date and time of your scheduled laboratory session. In the case of a valid excuse, please contact your TA as soon as possible to see about being assigned to another laboratory section later in the week. If you know in advance that you must miss a session, please inform your assigned TA know as soon as possible, so that s/he may re-assign you to another lab section.
Cellular phone policy: Please turnoff your cellular phone during sessions.
Allergies, athletics, and leaning disabilities: Please keep TAs informed. Most laboratory periods are conducted in the field. If you suffer from allergies, tell TAs so that they can inform you of any possible exposure to allergens. If

7

you are a member of a university athletic team (varsity, not intramural), please let TAs know when you will be outof-town to participate in these competitions. So that TAs can accommodate your needs, please provide documentation and information about a learning disability. Field trips -- On field days you must:
· Dress appropriately for the trip and weather; we will go rain or shine.
· Read each ecology exercise prior to attending that specific laboratory session.
· Get to Room 306 5 minutes early; we leave on time.

TEACHING ASSISTANT William McDowell William McDowell Shafkat Khan Shafkat Khan James Moree James Moree James Moree Shafkat Khan

Location: Laboratory sessions are held in the Biological Sciences Building, Room 306 (BioSci 306). The TA will take you to the laboratory location from BioSci 306. It is important that you meet with your laboratory group in BioSci 306, otherwise you may miss important announcements or schedule changes, which the TA is under no obligation to repeat. Vans will leave precisely on time. The van will return to the Ecology Building on time as well.
Laboratory Grading: Laboratories depend on experimental learning. Your laboratory grade is accrued out of 450 total points and is worth 30 percent of the course grade. 390 of the 450 points is based on assignments while the other 60 points are TA discretionary points, which are awarded based on your participation in field and laboratory exercises. Homework will not be accepted by email unless arranged ahead of time with your TA. If an assignment is late, the grade will be lowered 10 percent for each day it is late. If you have any problems with the grading of an assignment, please speak with your assigned TA about your concerns within one week after the assignment is returned.

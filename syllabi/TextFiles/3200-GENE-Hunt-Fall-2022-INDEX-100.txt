Prerequisite BIOL 1107 or BIOL 1107E or BIOL 2107H

Course description (from UGA bulletin) Genetic mechanisms in viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic cells in a comparative sense. Topics include molecular genetics and gene action, transfer systems and mapping, cytological, quantitative, and population genetics.

Course overview Genetics is central to the study of biology and plays important roles in both agriculture and medicine. Genetic variation also makes up the foundation for evolution. The objective of this course is to foster a basic understanding of key concepts in modern genetics, including fundamental principles underlying the transmission of genetic information, gene regulation, and population genetics. In order to better understand such concepts, we will discuss readings from the scientific literature.

Student learning outcomes  Students will be able to discuss and apply core concepts in transmission genetics, molecular
genetics, and population genetics  Students will be able to find, discuss, and summarize peer-reviewed research articles in genetics

The planned grade scale for the course is as follows: A = 4.0 (92-100%) B- = 2.7 (80-82%) D = 1.0 (60-69%) A- = 3.7 (90-91%) C+ = 2.3 (77-79%) F = 0.0 (<60%) B+ = 3.3 (87-89%) C = 2.0 (73-76%) B = 3.0 (83-86%) C- = 1.7 (70-72%)
Exams (55% of course grade) Five take-home exams will be assigned (weighted as 11% of course grade each). For these exams, you may consult the textbook and any other available resources. However, you are expected to answer questions yourself and, where applicable, answer using your own words, in paragraph form, incorporating your original thought. Do not communicate with classmates or anyone else directly about the specific exam questions (exams should be completed independently). Exam deadlines will be provided when each exam is made available on eLC.
Discussion board posts (20% of course grade) 1. "Peer-reviewed articles in genetics" eLC discussion board posts (10% of course grade):
Each student is required to start two new threads in which they post a link to a peer-reviewed manuscript with your reasoning for choosing the article to share. One article should be shared before the middle of the term - October 10 - and one article should be shared after midterm. Each student must also post responses to at least 2 articles posted by others - post at least one response before and after midterm (Oct 10). 2. "Genetics in the news" eLC discussion board posts (10% of course grade) Each student is required to post two new threads with a link to a recent article, video, or other media involving genetics in the news from 2022. One thread should be posted before the midterm - October 10 - and one should be posted after the midterm. Each student is also required to post responses to 2 threads posted by others - one before and one after midterm (Oct 10).
In-class participation and work (15% of course grade) Class time will involve discussion of course material and problem solving. Students are also responsible for reading papers in advance of discussion dates, and for having a copy of the relevant paper and their notes (in paper or electronic form) to reference during group discussion. Active participation in class work and discussions will be expected and required to obtain an `A' grade in participation. Any quizzes given will also contribute to this grade category.
Homework assignments and problems (7% of course grade) Assigned homework, including problem sets from the text, make up this grade category.
Completion of online pre- and post- course knowledge assessments and teaching evaluation (3% of course grade) One pre-course knowledge assessment and one post-course knowledge assessment will be given to assess departmental learning outcomes, and one teaching evaluation will be used to assess the instructor and improve the course. Completion of all three earns full credit for this grade category.
Academic honesty  UGA Student Honor Code: "I will be academically honest in all of my academic work and will not
tolerate academic dishonesty of others."  The University's policy and procedures for handling cases of suspected dishonesty can be found at
https://honesty.uga.edu/.  In this course, you are expected to complete take home exams without the assistance of others and
to bring original thought into your writing.

MARS 3450 Marine Biology Fall 2022 Syllabus
Instructors: Dr. Holly Bik (102 Marine Sciences Building, hbik@uga.edu) Dr. Jaclyn Saunders (250 Marine Sciences Building, Jaci@uga.edu)
Office Hours: By appointment (via Zoom); please request meetings via email or eLC
Course Format and Class Timings: · This course will operate as a "flipped classroom" · Lectures and course assessments will be asynchronous, posted on eLC · In-person classroom discussions Tues/Thurs 2:20pm-3:35pm, Marine Sciences 239
Required Course Material: 1. Textbook: "Marine Biology: Function, Biodiversity, and Ecology" 5th Edition, by
Jeffrey S. Levinton. The print book will be available at the UGA Library course reserves, but you are encouraged to rent or purchase your own copy. Prior or more recent editions of this textbook are not acceptable to use because of significant differences in text organization and chapter structure between editions. 2. Other readings will be assigned, and will be available on eLC. Please check the course announcements and online course materials frequently.
Course Aims: In Marine Biology we will study the organisms that live in the ocean and learn about the ecosystems they participate in, including human impacts on marine species. The primary focus of this course is the organisms themselves - illustrating how organisms function in an ecological and evolutionary context (from physiology to genetics to behavior). We will cover major groups of marine organisms (primary producers, invertebrates, and vertebrates), as well as selected ecosystems (such as the pelagic environment, coral reefs, the deep sea, and salt marshes).

GRADING: Your overall course grade will be calculated as follows:
30% Final Exam 20% Midterm Exam 30% Quizzes 20% Class Participation (points given for viewing and completing content on eLC ONLY - no participation credit is associated with attendance at in-person class discussions)
Exams and Quizzes = 80% of the course grade. These may cover material from lectures, assigned readings (textbook and scientific
papers), and video content (links in lectures and videos posted on eLC). Exam dates are listed in the above class schedule, and Quizzes will be posted in eLC (see details below)
Class Participation = 20% of course grade This will include lecture viewing and completion of other eLC content (quizzes, videos,
readings, and other course content posted online). Participation credit will be awarded based on due dates specified in eLC. Asynchronous lectures on eLC MUST be completed by 11:59pm on the date corresponding to the specific lecture topic (as listed above). Students who view a lecture after the due date listed on eLC will not receive participation credit for that lecture; credit is determined according to the eLC timestamp for lecture completion. Asynchronous lectures will be posted on eLC one week prior to the due date. Full participation credit will be awarded to students with 80% or more of the total possible participation points over the course of the semester. Below this 80% threshold, the credit awarded will equal the % credit earned.
Letter Grades. The following is a general guide for grade assignment in this course. The exact correspondence between calculated numeric grades and assigned letter-grades is at the discretion of the course professor.

Midterms and Final: The Midterm Exam will account for 20% of the overall course grade and will cover material from the first eight weeks of lectures. The Final Exam will be cumulative (covering material from the entire semester) and will account for 30% of the overall course grade. Midterm and Final exams will contain a mixture of multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions. For Fall 2022, both Midterm and Final Exams will be TIMED, OPEN BOOK exams completed on eLC during our assigned classroom timeslot. You will have access to your notes and textbook, however it is critical that you learn the material before the exam; you will not have enough time to look up every answer, and you will struggle to complete short answer and essay questions if you have not been engaged with the course content.
Quizzes: There will be a total of fourteen quizzes over the course of the semester, and the overall average of these quizzes will comprise 20% of the course grade. The lowest three quiz scores will be dropped before the quiz average is calculated. Online quizzes will be posted in eLC and will need to be completed by Sunday each week (online quizzes will close each Sunday at 11:59pm EST). There will be no quizzes during Week 9 (midterms week) or Week 15 (Thanksgiving break). Weekly assessments are a low stakes method that tests your knowledge of the material covered in class - so it is important that you complete the weekly lectures and review the assigned textbook readings.
Make-up policies: Make-up exams will be offered only in the cases of serious medical or other personal emergencies that prevent a student from taking the regularly scheduled exam. Any student who finds themselves in this situation should contact the Dr. Bik and Dr. Saunders before the regularly scheduled exam if at all possible, and in any case not more than 24 hours after the exam. Documentation from a health care provider (in the case of illness), or other sources as appropriate, will be required. The decision to offer a make-up exam is at the sole discretion of the course instructor. If you require a makeup exam, it will contain different questions and may be different in form (in terms of question type and number of questions) than the normal exam taking during the allocated class timeslot.
Learning Objectives:
By the end of this course, students should be able to: 1. Identify and describe the major groups of marine organisms. 2. Compare and contrast the features of different marine habitats, and assess the ecological and evolutionary adaptations of the organisms present in each habitat. 3. Summarize how marine organisms interact with each other and their environment. 4. Interpret and explain scientific figures and technical research articles. 5. Predict the future impacts of human activities on marine organisms and ecosystems.
Online Resources: Updated class schedule and readings, project and exercise information, lecture notes (when available), exam grades, and administrative information will be posted on eLC (https://uga.view.usg.edu/).
Disability Accommodations: UGA is committed to providing equal access to learning opportunities for all students. If you have a disability and would like to request specific accommodations, please contact your instructor. If you plan to request accommodations for a

Academic Honesty: As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty," and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the course instructors. Honesty is fundamental to everything we do at the University: all meaningful learning and research is predicated on academic honesty. Academic dishonesty harms and degrades your classmates and teachers, and it ultimately harms and degrades you. If you have any questions regarding what constitutes honest or dishonest behavior, your instructor is able to discuss these issues with you.
Peer Tutoring: The Division of Academic Enhancement (DAE) offers free peer tutoring in over 200 of UGA's most rigorous courses including writing tutoring. For more information on how to engage with a Peer Tutor email tutor@uga.edu or visit https://dae.uga.edu/services/tutoring/ In addition to peer tutoring, the DAE also provides Academic Coaching, Student Success Workshops and more. The DAE is committed to the success of all students at the University of Georgia. For more on these and other resources, please visit dae.uga.edu.

Fall 2018 Syllabus
Course Description
How are our lives shaped by the environment around us? And, as scientists argue about whether or not we've entered a new age called "The Anthropocene", how great an impact have humans really made on the environment, from prehistory right up until today? This course will consider the complexities of human-environment interactions using a diachronic and comparative perspective only possible through an archaeological lens. It will explore the ecological relationships between people, animals, and plants in the past and discuss the implications of these dynamic relationships in an increasingly globalized world.
Textbook and Course Materials
One book is required: Environmental Archaeology, by E. J. Reitz & M. Shackley (2012).
All readings should be completed before lectures. Additional readings may be assigned. Graduate students are required to complete an additional 5 readings.

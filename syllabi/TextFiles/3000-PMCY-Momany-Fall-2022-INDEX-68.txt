ASSESSMENTS/EVALUATIONS

Four tests, each worth 25% of the grade, will constitute the grading of the course:

Test 1

September 15

2:20 PM - 3:35 PM

Test 2

October 13

2:20 PM - 3:35 PM

Test 3

November 8

2:20 PM - 3:35 PM

Test 4

December 12

12:00 PM - 1:15 PM

All Tests will be delivered in the classroom using a Respondus Lock-down Browser interfaced to ELC. A modern computer (Windows PC 7-10, Mac OS X10.12 or higher, or iPad iOS10.0) is critical for tests. A student ID must be available during tests. A practice syllabus quiz (1% of the grade as a bonus) will be made available in eLC to test equipment capabilities before tests and to evaluate knowledge of the syllabus. An additional 1% bonus will be assigned as a percentage of classes the student attends collected via TopHat.

Tests will be primarily multiple-choice format with some short answer or essay-format questions. Each test may be cumulative relative to previous tests. Test questions will be formed to evaluate a deep understanding of material beyond rote memorization or "googleable" facts. No assistance is allowed during the tests, and a significant investment in study is expected and necessary to be successful in this course. Tests are timed and given during scheduled class times only. Students are not allowed to have any items nearby or on their body that can communicate electronically via Bluetooth or WiFi - including, but not restricted to, digital watches, phones, microphones, earphones, video cameras, computersany electronic resource near or on their person during the exams.

The course letter grade cutoffs will be determined by summing all available scores for the tests and attendance/syllabus quizzes. In the absence of a curve, the letter grade assignments will be: A >92, A- 89<92, B+ 86<89, B 82<86, B- 79<82, C+ 76<79, C 70<76, C69<70, D 60<69, F<60. Individual test distributions will be corrected based on statistical analysis using Discrimination and Difficulty Indices (e.g. answers may be tossed at the instructor's discretion). In the event that a curve is deemed necessary (for instance if the average is below a "C"), the letter grade distribution will be derived from Z-scoring (a normalization scheme), the details of which will be provided before the final exam. The change in letter grade cutoffs will only be made to benefit the student (the cutoffs can only move down). It is possible for all students in the class to get "A" grades.

CLASS ATTENDANCE, ABSENCES, AND HONOR CODE
If a student must miss an exam due to sickness, the student must follow the policies defined by the University and inform the instructor, either directly or through the University Student Affairs office, of the situation prior to the exam being given. Documentation supporting the reasons for the absence will be required. In cases of COVID infections, follow current university guidelines. Do not come to class sick. An unexcused absence from an exam will result in a zero for that exam. Makeup exams for excused absences only will be rescheduled and may include any format of question, including possibly all essay format, at the discretion of the instructor(s) that are responsible for the content covered. When multiple students miss an examination, the same exam will be used for all absent students and it will be given at the same time, possibly utilizing Respondus Monitor.

PMCY3000 Syllabus The UGA Honor Code must always be followed. Any student that uses outside assistance (unless specifically allowed) on quizzes, tests, assignments, or other activities will be in a violation of the University Honor Code. Practice quiz questions are not to be discussed or maintained in any format that might be shared with other students that may take the quiz in the future. Quiz questions can be used for personal study. Students that have taken quizzes may discuss them with other students that have taken the same quizzes. As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty," and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at https://honesty.uga.edu/. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for any violation of the honor code. Any questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.

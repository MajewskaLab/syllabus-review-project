EXAMS AND GRADING: There will be four exams (worth 100 points each), at the times noted on the attached schedule. The final exam is the fourth regular exam and is not cumulative. The instructors may give "pop quizzes" during lectures to encourage attendance. Points from pop quizzes will be added as a "bonus" to the final grade of 400 total points for the four exams. Pop quizzes cannot be taken at a later time/date for any reason.

For the total course grade percentage (based on points earned divided by 400 points), the following grades are guaranteed: 70-76 C; 77-79 C+; 80-82 B-; 83-86 B; 87-89 B+; 90-92 A-; 93-100 A. In computing final grades, adjustments to extend letter grades to lower numerical ranges may be made on a class-wide basis at the discretion of the faculty. Incomplete grades will not be given unless there is a compelling medical or personal issue that prevents the completion of the course.

Make-up exams will only be given if students have obtained permission to miss the exam in advance from the professor that is giving the exam; this will require a compelling reason that must be documented.

Issues related to academic honesty will be dealt with according to the guidelines and procedures described in the booklet: "A Culture of Honesty: Policies and Procedures on Academic Honesty".

STUDY SUPPORT: Lecturers will make study guides available to you through eLearnings Commons covering their respective topics. These may include PowerPoint files, reading assignments, and study questions. A weekly review session hosted by the TA will provide insights into how to approach the study guide material. The review session will be Wednesdays at 7:00 PM - room 404D, Biological Sciences Bldg.

You are invited to speak with the lecturers either briefly after class or during their office hours. The TA is also available if you would like to obtain personal help with subject matter. If the scheduled office hours are not convenient then you may arrange another time. Matters of course content should be addressed to the relevant lecturer. Administrative questions should be addressed to the lecturer who currently teaching. We encourage you to ask questions during the lectures.

UGA Microbiology 4700/6700 Medical Mycology Fall Semester 2014
Alan Langford, MD, FAAD, DipID

Lecture:

Tu., Th. (9:30 am - 10:45 am) in room 338, Wilson Pharmacy Bldg.

Prerequisite:

BIOL 1108. Suggested pre- or co-req: BCMB 3100. If problems registering, those students can seek permission to register with Ms. Kimberly Brown or her designee, Room 527, Microbiology Department, in BioSciences Building.

Instructor:

Alan Langford, M.D. Offices: 270-D Wilson Pharmacy Building Email: alangfor@uga.edu

UGA Catalog Course Description: A survey of yeasts, molds, and Actinomycetes most likely encountered by a medical mycologist in a
diagnostic laboratory with special emphasis on the organisms pathogenic for man.

Dr. Langford's Description: This is a course on human fungal diseases and their corresponding organisms. Emphasis will be on recognition and identification of pat hogens, disease prese ntations, and an introduction to mycologica l disease, diagnosis, and treatment in patients. An overview of the filamentous prokaryotic "higher" bacteria (Actinomycetes) will be covered, as per tradtion. This is not a course on mycological physiology, metabolism, genetics, or molecular medicine. The content will be similar to that in many 2nd year medical school courses. Studies of patient case histories will be used. Students accepted to medical schools often use this course as a transition t o medical studies. "Host vs. Pathogen" concepts as virulence mechanisms, & evasion of host immune defense "strategies" are discussed.

The textbook is optional, as many materials are posted on the UGA eLC. (Also note list of internet websites/URL's: premed.uga.edu/4700.htm)

Course materials (including materials projected during lectures): class on UGA eLearning Commons www.elc.uga.edu
OR https://uga.view.usg.edu/

To be available by first day of

Text: Fungal Infection: Diagnosis and Management by Richardson & Warnock, Blackwell ( 2nd, 3rd, or 4th or later editions. Chapters in syllabus listed for 3rd edition.) Again, text is OPTIONAL.

Class Attendance Policy: Students are expected to attend class regul arly. Excessive absences ma y well result in dismissal at the discretion of Dr. L angford. Missing a test or an exam results in a "make-up" (IF excused) oral or timely written essay examination (not Scantron® graded). Timely and excuses/reasons must be provided. Prior e-mail notice of absence to instructor is expected. Unexcused absence for tests and final exam will result in a zero. It is quit e difficult to do well on tests and exams without attending class, listening well, and efficiently taking notes for later study. Students w ho miss class should not ask the instructor to repeat the lecture, but have discussion with a trusted reliable classmate AND study eLC and resources posted in syllabus. Questions in class are encouraged.!!! Roll will be taken @ times, but not daily.
***To start studying content, first read materials 'like a novel or a daily newpaper article'! Office sessions are to be arranged before or after lectures.

valid

Tests: There are f our major tests plus a comprehensive final exam (on dates listed) and each is weighed
equally (Scantron® grading). Cheating on tests, exams, and papers is not tolerated whatsoever!

Note: Tests II and III and Final Exam will cover material from any prior lecture/readings. *Test IV is a "take home, " open-book, but NOT an "open-person" exam. Students are NOT to collaborate with (or consult with) other humans, which would create an Academic Disho nesty Violation. It consists of six sections, each based on one of six review articles. (approx. 30-33 questions per article). Four of the six should help in study for Test III. All 6 help for final exam. Articles and the six exam question sections are included in the postings on the eLC site for the course. Students must obtain in previous class time Scantron® answer sheets for machine grading.

All academic work must meet the standards contained in UGA's "A Culture of Honesty." Students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before prforming any academic work. The link to more detailed information about academic honesty can be found at:

http://www.uga.edu/ovpi/honesty/acadhon.htm.

MIBO 6700 and Honors Option Students (*or any student who wants another grade**): Extra written paper required. Discuss topic choice during semester with Dr. Lan gford in se mester. Other students may produce papers, in effort to raise average (one sixth of final grade). Papers should b e of reasonable font, 8-10 pages (typed and double-spaced) with bibliography listed with 8 to 10 valid journal articles (one or two texts acceptable). A "perfect" well-done review article grade will "max-out" at 95%. To earn a 95-100 grade requires a significant answered premise (with valid conclusion and comments on "what next?"). "Due date" for submission is listed on course calendar. Honors/extra credit term paper is equal "in weight" to a single test.

GRADES:

A =

93.00 to 100.0

A- =

89.00 to 92.99

B+ =

86.00 to 88.99

B =

83.00 to 85.99

B- =

79.00 to 82.99

C+ =

76.00 to 78.99

C =

73.00 to 75.99

C- =

69.50 to 72.99

D =

59.50 to 69.49

F =

00.00 to 59.49

Questions re: test answers on tests/exams are welcomed for learning purposes. Asking for "2nd-best answer or half-credit" individually to generate grade of, for example

`96' rather t han, `95' is not. Students who wish to `appeal' an answer for specific question(s) should

keep a personal log ("diary") with date and items for discussion in th e event that the original overall

grade calculated results in an '82.89', for example, and a grade of `B', rather than `B-`, might be

reasonable, upon, review of the student `log' (i.e., when it "really matters"), when submitted for negotiation

and consideration to & by the faculty instructor.

The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations (including test date changes) announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary. (And the right to do so is reserved). Students are responsible for announcements made in class, preferrably from another student, if absent.

MAKE-UP EXAM AND EXTRA CREDIT POLICIES
Make-up exams will only be offered in cases of serious medical or personal circumstances that prevent a student from taking the regularly scheduled exam. Any student who finds him/herself in this situation should contact Dr. Binder before the regularly scheduled exam if at all possible, and in any case not more than 24 h after the exam. Documentation from a health care provider (in the case of illness), or other sources as appropriate, will be required. The decision to offer a make-up exam is at the sole discretion of Dr. Binder.
No make-ups will be available for in-class exercises.
No extra credit is available for this course.
ACADEMIC HONESTY:
As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty," and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: https://honesty.uga.edu/AcademicHonesty-Policy/. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.
Honesty is fundamental to everything we do at the University: all meaningful learning and research is predicated on academic honesty. Academic dishonesty harms and degrades your classmates and teachers, and it ultimately harms and degrades you. If you have any questions regarding what constitutes honest or dishonest behavior, Dr. Binder will be happy to discuss these issues with you.
Suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued according to the policies outlined in "A Culture of Honesty."
CELL PHONES AND OTHER PERSONAL ELECTRONIC DEVICES:
Cell phones should be silenced during lectures! Please be considerate of your fellow classmates and your instructor, and don't engage in phone conversations or texting during class.
Laptops are currently permitted during lectures, but their use should be restricted to appropriate class-related activities (e.g. note-taking). Laptop use in the classroom is a privilege, not a right, and this privilege may be revoked if it is abused.
During exams, the use of cell phones, laptops, and all other personal electronic devices is expressly prohibited.
SYLLABUS DISCLAIMER
This course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.
Updated lecture schedules and other changes will be announced in class and posted on eLC as necessary. Information posted on eLC takes precedence over all previously announced or posted information.

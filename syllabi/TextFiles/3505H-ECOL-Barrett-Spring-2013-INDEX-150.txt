Information:

In addition to assignments from the text, you are responsible for information encompassing lecture notes, handouts, DVDs, additional reading assignments, and class discussions. Therefore, attendance is mandatory if you are to maximize your understanding of principles, concepts, mechanisms, and natural laws that are presented during this course. All academic work must meet the standards contained in "a culture of honesty." Students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work (http://honesty.uga.edu/ahpd/culture_honesty.htm).

It is important to understand that a possible grade for withdrawal after the midpoint of the semester is a WF, which carries the same numerical grade as an F (0 points). A WF will be given 2 school days following the midpoint withdrawal deadline (21 March 2013) to those students who have stopped attending class, failed to take test #1, and consequently are failing the course at that time.

It is your responsibility to make certain that all laboratory assignments are turned in on time, and that you know your grade regarding these assignments. Once the final laboratory grade is turned in to Dr. Barrett, there will be no consideration regarding changing this grade.

COURSE INFORMATION
Description: Lecture, discussions, laboratory sessions, and field trips about the science of ecology mainly focus on the following levels of organization: organism, population, community, ecosystem, landscape, biome, and global. As summarized in the lecture syllabus, a broad range of topics related to the science of ecology will be covered. The lecture material will assume that you have a basic knowledge of general biology (BIOL 1108 or equivalent is a prerequisite for this course). This course also prepares you for advanced courses in limnology, population and community ecology, behavioral ecology, and ecosystem ecology.
Textbook: The text Fundamentals of Ecology, Fifth Edition, by Eugene P. Odum and Gary W. Barrett can be purchased from the University bookstore. You are expected to read the appropriate assigned chapters before each lecture is presented. Additional readings will be used as complementary material for lecture.
Examinations/Grading: There will be two major tests and a final exam. The final exam (3 hours) is scheduled for 8:00 -11:00 a.m. on Tuesday, 7 May 2013. Grades will be based on the following criteria:

Test 1 Test 2 Discussion Lab Final Exam

20% 20% 15% 25% 20%

90 - 100% A 80 - 89% B 70 - 79% C 60 - 69% D
< 60% F

Example: 87% - 89% B+ 83% - 86% B 80% - 82% B-

The final exam will cover material presented in lectures from 19 March through 25 April.
Overview comments: I will periodically provide you with the opportunity to receive "Bonus Points." You must follow instructions to receive bonus points. These points will be added to the next scheduled exam. You will not be permitted to do special projects (e.g., term papers) to improve your grade later in the semester. Attend each lecture and laboratory session, understand course material on a daily basis, and you will perform well in the course. We will make a sincere effort to enrich your learning experience.

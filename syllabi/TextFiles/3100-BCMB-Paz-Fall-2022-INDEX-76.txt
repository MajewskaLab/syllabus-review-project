The University of Georgia-Griffin Campus
BCMB 3100 CRN 30912. 4 credit hours INTRODUCTORY BIOCHEMISTRY and MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Fall 2022, 12:45-2:30 PM In-Person Class, MW

Instructor:

Dr. Margie M. Paz mpaz@uga.edu 128 Flynt Bldg. 770-229-3380

Office Hours: 10:45 - 11:45 AM Mon/Wed. Please e-mail me, so a meeting can be set up. To comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), all communication must be through a secure medium (UGAMail or eLC). Instructors are not allowed to respond to messages that refer to individual students or student progress in the course through non-UGA accounts.

Course Overview: The objective of this course is to introduce you to the chemistry of life and provide a basis for further studies in biological sciences. The course material includes the structure and function of biological molecules, enzymology, metabolism, bioenergetics, and application of the knowledge to solve, analyze, interpret, and evaluate biochemical data. The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.

Prerequisites: (CHEM 2211 or CHEM 2311H or CHEM 2411) and (CHEM 2211L or CHEM 2311L or CHEM 2411L) and (BIOL 1107 or BIOL 2107H)

Textbook: Principles of Biochemistry, 5th edition. Moran, Horton, Scrimgeour, Perry (2012) Pearson ISBN-10: 0321707338 ISBN-13: 978-0321707338

Attendance: Students are expected to attend all lectures. Lecture slides will be available on the web via eLC to simplify note-taking. However, the lecture notes on eLC should not be regarded as a substitute for attending class. Students are responsible for having access to the eLC course content using a laptop computer/tablet or printing their own copies and should do so before class. Having the lecture slides with you will make note-taking easier, but additional material and examples are given in class. You should be prepared to take notes on blank sheets of paper (or slide handout or laptop) at any time. You will be responsible for all content and instructions given during the lecture and announcements made in class (including on days when you miss a class). Please turn off all cell phones and pagers during class.

e-LearningCommons (eLC): We will be using eLC throughout the term. I often communicate via eLC, which you should check regularly. Class material including the syllabus, slides of lecture notes, and course announcements will be posted on the eLC course page. To get to the course page, go to https://uga.view.usg.edu Login with your UGA MyID.

In-class Activities: We will have in-class exercises to work on problems and review questions. The in-class activities are designed to apply the knowledge and concepts you have learned from the lecture to solve biochemical problems and analyze biochemical data. These will also help you prepare for exams.

Grading: Grades will be based on 5 exams, a final exam, 6 quizzes/homework, and 6 assignments. Late submissions will not be accepted. Make-up exams will come from a test bank and may not reflect the material emphasized in lecture. A WRITTEN EXCUSE is REQUIRED for all make-up exams. In the case of severe illness or family emergency, you must inform and email the instructor prior to the exam. In addition, presentation of a signed letter from your doctor, etc., will

be required. An unexcused absence will result in a grade of zero. An absence will be counted as unexcused if the instructor is not notified before the exam is given. If you believe there has been a grading error on your exam, questions about grading must be submitted in writing within one week of the return of the exam.

Grades: 5 Exams (100 pts each) Final Exam Assignments (3 pts each) HW/Quizzes Total

500 pts 150 pts 18 pts 32 pts 700 pts

If your pre-final grade is greater than or equal to 65%, and you are satisfied with your grade, you have the option to not take the final exam and your grade will be based on the points listed below. (Make sure you check your minimum grade requirement if this course counts toward your major.) If you missed an exam, you need to take the final exam.

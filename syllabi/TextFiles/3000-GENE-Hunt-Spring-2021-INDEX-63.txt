Course Description (from UGA bulletin) An introduction to biological evolution, from the level of genes to populations to species.
Course Objective The objective of this course is to foster a basic understanding of key concepts in evolutionary biology. The course provides an introduction to population genetics and evolutionary processes. We will discuss readings to better understand course topics and to gain experience digesting the primary scientific literature.
Prerequisites Principles of Biology I-II or equivalent.
Text Herron and Freeman. Evolutionary Analysis. 5th Ed. ISBN-10: 0321616677
e-LearningCommons (eLC) Class materials including the syllabus, lecture slides, readings, and course announcements will be posted on the eLC course page at https://uga.view.usg.edu. Login with your UGA MyID.
Coronavirus Information As a reminder, the University of Georgia--along with all University System of Georgia (USG) institutions--requires all faculty, staff, students, and visitors to wear an appropriate face covering while inside campus facilities/buildings. Any student with a positive COVID-19 test is required to report the test in DawgCheck and should self-isolate immediately. Students should not attend classes in-person until the isolation period is completed. Once you report the positive test through DawgCheck, UGA Student Care and Outreach will follow up with you. Effective Jan. 4, 2021, students who learn they have been directly exposed to COVID-19 but are not showing symptoms should self-quarantine for 10 days (consistent with updated Department of Public Health (DPH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines). Those quarantining for 10 days must have been symptom-free throughout the monitoring period. Please correspond with your instructor via email, with a cc: to Student Care & Outreach at sco@uga.edu, to coordinate continuing your coursework while self-quarantined.
Attendance With few students, attendance is important, and regular attendance when healthy is required for a good participation grade. But please do not show up to class if exhibiting symptoms of any illness.
Academic Honesty As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the UGA Student Honor Code: "I will be academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others." A Culture of Honesty, the University's policy and procedures for handling cases of suspected dishonesty, can be found at https://honesty.uga.edu/.

Assignments

Assignments will consist primarily of written summaries and responses to papers.

Exams

Four exams will be given that will consist primarily of short answer questions.

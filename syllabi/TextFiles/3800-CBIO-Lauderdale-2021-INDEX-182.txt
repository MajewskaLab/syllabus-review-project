General Information
Credit Hours: 4.0. Students who are successful in this course typically spend 8 to 12 hours outside of class per week studying the material covered in lectures
Prerequisites: Biology 1103 and 1104, or 1107 and 1108, or equivalent are prerequisites for this course. It is assumed that you have fulfilled these requirements.
Online teaching: Due to the size of this class, all instruction will be given online in an synchronous manner (live lectures on zoom) and quizzes and exams will also occur online. We aim to record each lecture and post the recordings on eLC for your convenience. However, we strongly encourage attendance in each class. Furthermore, we encourage that students keep their video on, this will help the instructors to get to know students better in an already difficult online setting and thus will improve your and our experience.
Mental Health and Wellness Resources: If you or someone you know needs assistance, you are encouraged to contact Student Care and Outreach in the Division of Student Affairs at 706-542-7774 or visit https://sco.uga.edu. They will help you navigate any difficult circumstances you may be facing by connecting you with the appropriate resources or services. UGA has several resources for a student seeking mental health services (https://www.uhs.uga.edu/bewelluga/bewelluga) or crisis support (https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies). If you need help managing stress anxiety, relationships, etc., please visit BeWellUGA (https://www.uhs.uga.edu/bewelluga/bewelluga) for a list of FREE workshops, classes, mentoring, and health coaching led by licensed clinicians and health educators in the University Health Center. Additional resources can be accessed through the UGA App.
Coronavirus Information for Students: Face Coverings: As a reminder, the University of Georgia--along with all University System of Georgia (USG) institutions--requires all faculty, staff, students, and visitors to wear an appropriate face covering while inside campus facilities/buildings where six feet social distancing may not always be possible. Anyone not using a face covering when required will be asked to wear one or must leave the area. Reasonable accommodations may be made for those who are unable to wear a face covering for documented health
Page 2 of 6

reasons. Students seeking an accommodation related to face coverings should contact Disability Services at https://drc.uga.edu/.
DawgCheck: Please perform a quick symptom check each weekday on DawgCheck--on the UGA app or website-- whether you feel sick or not. It will help health providers monitor the health situation on campus: https://dawgcheck.uga.edu/
What do I do if I have symptoms? Students showing symptoms should self-isolate and schedule an appointment with the University Health Center by calling 706-542-1162 (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.). Please DO NOT walk-in. For emergencies and after-hours care, see https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies.
What do I do if I test positive? Any student with a positive COVID-19 test is required to report the test in DawgCheck and should selfisolate immediately. Students should not attend classes in-person until the isolation period is completed. Once you report the positive test through DawgCheck, UGA Student Care and Outreach will follow up with you.
What do I do if I am notified that I have been exposed? Revised Guidelines for COVID-19 Quarantine Period Effective Jan. 4, 2021, students who learn they have been directly exposed to COVID-19 but are not showing symptoms should self-quarantine for 10 days (consistent with updated Department of Public Health (DPH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines). Those quarantining for 10 days must have been symptom-free throughout the monitoring period. Please correspond with your instructor via email, with a cc: to Student Care & Outreach at sco@uga.edu, to coordinate continuing your coursework while self-quarantined. We strongly encourage students to voluntarily take a COVID-19 test within 48 hours of the end of the 10day quarantine period (test to be administered between days 8 and 10). Students may obtain these tests at Legion Field (https://clia.vetview.vet.uga.edu/) or at the University Health Center by calling 706-5421162 (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.). Please DO NOT walk-in the University Health Center without an appointment. For emergencies and after-hours care, see https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies If the test is negative, the individual may return to campus, but MUST continue to closely monitor for any new COVID-19 symptoms through 14 days. DawgCheck is the best method for monitoring these symptoms. If new symptoms occur, the individual must not come to campus and must seek further testing/evaluation. If the test is positive at the end of the 10-day period, the individual must begin a 10-day isolation period from the date of the test.
How do I participate in surveillance testing if I have NO symptoms? We strongly encourage you to take advantage of the expanded surveillance testing that is being offered from January 4 - 22: up to 1,500 free tests per day at Legion Field and pop-up locations. Testing at Legion Field can be scheduled at https://clia.vetview.vet.uga.edu/. Walk-up appointments can usually be accommodated at Legion Field, and pop-up saliva testing does not require pre-registration. For planning purposes, precise sites and schedules for the pop-up clinics are published on the UHC's website and its social media as they are secured: https://www.uhs.uga.edu/healthtopics/covid-surveillance-testing.

Honors Option
In accordance with the requirements of the Honors Program at The University of Georgia, students who wish to earn Honors credit for BIOL/CBIO 3800, Neurobiology, are expected to complete additional academic work, as well as the normal course requirements for this class. To receive Honors credit in this class, students will be asked to prepare a research proposal that focuses on a current topic in neurobiology. This topic can be picked from a list of topics provided by the instructors, or students may suggest topics if they have specific interests, but instructor approval is required.
Students will research their chosen topic, develop a hypothesis that addresses one aspect of this topic, and then propose at least two experiments designed to test their hypothesis. The proposal will have the following parts: (1) an Abstract briefly stating the problem, what is known about the problem, the hypothesis that is being tested, and the specific aims of the research proposal (what experiments are you going to use to test your hypothesis and what do you hope to accomplish with your experiments?); (2) an Introduction that will address the background leading to the development of the hypothesis and the significance of the problem; (3) the Research Design and Methods (what experiments are you going to
Page 5 of 6

use to test your hypothesis and why); and (4) a discussion about all possible outcomes from the experiments: the student is expected to predict both the results that would be consistent, or inconsistent with the hypothesis, or other novel findings and their implications.
The proposal should be approximately 7 to 10 pages in length (not including citations), single spaced, with one-inch margins, and use a font size of 12 points. You may want to include figures or drawings to help clarify your presentation. Additional information and guidelines pertaining to the format of the proposal will be made available to you by your instructors. A draft of the abstract is due no later than March 1st, and the final research proposal is due no later than the last day of class.
Sections in Research Proposal Abstract/ Specific Aims (1 page or less) A brief statement of the problem, what is known about the problem that lead to the development of the hypothesis to be tested, and a brief statement of how you are going to test the hypothesis. The hypothesis must be clearly indicated. The specific aims should be statements of what you want to test.
Introduction (~2-3 pages) State the hypothesis to be tested at the top of the page Background and significance (What is known about this problem; why is it important? Be sure to discuss previous experiments that lead to the development of your hypothesis!)
Specific Aims of the proposal (What do you hope to test in more detail) and Experimental Design (~4-6 pages) Describe what the experiment is designed to test. Give a brief description of the methods to be used. Use only accepted protocols; give citations. Include the appropriate controls that would help you interpret your experiments! Describe outcome(s) that would support your hypothesis and state why. Describe outcomes that would not support your hypothesis and state why.
Literature Cited (~ 1-3 pages) Complete citations.

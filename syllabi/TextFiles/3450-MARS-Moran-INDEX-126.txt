MARS3450 2021 - Semester at Sapelo Course Information Sheet

GRADING POLICY Three exams and a non-cumulative final will be given, each of which will count
for 23% of the course grade.

In-class activities count for the remaining 8% of the course grade, consisting of grades for active learning exercises.
The following is a general guide for letter-grade assignment in this course. The exact correspondence between calculated number grades and assigned letter-grades is at the discretion of Dr. Moran, but grade cutoffs will not be higher than indicated here (for example, the cutoff for an A- could be lower than 90, but will not be higher).

Students are not allowed to make up missed exams. However, unavoidable circumstances and serious health issues will be considered if you contact Dr. Moran BEFORE the exam and fully document the situation.
TEXTBOOK (NOT REQUIRED, BUT A GOOD REFERENCE) Marine Biology, Function, Biodiversity, and Ecology. 5th edition, Jeffrey S.
Levinton. Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-985712-8. 2014.
ELECTRONICS USE POLICY Please refrain from using your phone during class and use your computer only
for lecture related activities.

STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES Students with disabilities who require accommodations in order to participate in
course activities or meet course requirements should contact Dr. Moran.
COURSE OBJECTIVE To become familiar with marine organisms and the ecological interactions that
occur within major marine environments.
EXPECTED LEARNING OUTCOMES 1. Students will be familiar with marine organisms, including microbes, plants, and animals. 2. Students will be familiar with how marine organisms function within coastal and oceanic marine ecosystems. 3. Students will be familiar with how marine organisms interact with each other and their environment. 4. Student mastery of the material will be measured by 3 exams, 1 final, and inclass activities/quizzes.
The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.

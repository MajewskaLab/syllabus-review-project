COURSE DESCRIPTION: MIBO 3500 provides an introduction to microorganisms with a special emphasis on bacteria, their structure, function, diversity, and importance to man. Pre or Corequisite: (CHEM 2211 or CHEM 2311H or CHEM 2411) and (CHEM 2211L or CHEM 2311L or CHEM 2411L) and BIOL 1107 or BIOL 1107E or BIOL 2107H

TEXTBOOK (RECOMMENDED NOT REQUIRED): Microbiology An Evolving Science. 4th edition. 2017Slonczewski and Foster. W.W. Norton and Company. ISBN9780393602340

METHODS OF INSTRUCTION: Lectures will be comprised of a combination of PowerPoint presentations, group-discussions, and case-study activities. PowerPoint presentations and other handouts will be available on eLC for students to download.

EMAIL POLICY: Students are divided into TA groups (listed in eLC gradebook). Each group is assigned a course TA who will be their primary email contact. Students should address all course questions first to their TA. However, concerns regarding missed assignments, disability accommodations, or problems accessing quizzes should first be directed to Dr. Scott. All emails will receive a response within 24 hours Mon-Fri.

ATTENDANCE POLICY: PowerPoint slides and handouts contain an outline and not a complete description of a class discussion, therefore students should attend all lectures regularly. Students who have a legitimate and documented excuse for an absence (illness, family emergency, etc.) should contact Dr. Scott as soon as possible to go over missed material and make up any missed assignments. If a student is late to class on an exam day the exam will be considered late (ie. a grade of zero). Exceptions for late exams can be considered for excused absences and
arriving to class late but before another other student has turned in their exam and left the room. All exams

must be turned in promptly when the class period is over or they are considered late (ie. a grade of zero) with exceptions for DRC extended time accommodations.
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES: Students with disabilities who believe that they need accommodations in this course are encouraged to contact the Disabilities Resource Center as soon as possible to ensure such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.

GRADING SCALE AND EVALUATION:
eLC quizzes: There will be 6 online quizzes each worth 20 points. Quizzes are "closed note" and consist of 10 multiple choice/true-false questions worth 2 pts each. Quizzes are timed at 10 minutes. Each quiz may be attempted twice with the higher of the two scores being recorded in the gradebook. Questions come from eLC question bank so exact combination of questions on a second attempt may not be the same as first attempt. Quizzes are due at 11:30pm on indicated due date and will open at least two days ahead of time. The lowest of these 6 scores will be dropped.
Exams: There will be 3 in-class exams and 1 in-class cumulative final exam each worth 100 points. The lowest of these four exam scores will be dropped. Thus, if a student is satisfied with their course grade prior to taking the final exam they may choose to not take the final. Exams may cover any material discussed in class (including case studies and Packback material discussed in class).
Case Studies: Students will work in groups (or individually) outside of class to analyze 4 pieces of relevant literature each worth 25 points. Completed case studies will be due and discussed as a class on indicated discussion day. No case study scores will be dropped.
Discussion Questions: There will be 6 in-class discussion questions that will be given unannounced throughout the semester. Each is worth 10 points. These questions are "open-note" and may be completed as a group. They may cover any topic that has been discussed in class since previous discussion question. The lowest of these six scores will be dropped.
Packback Curiosity Questions: Students will post curiosity questions and respond to at least two questions from their peers on the indicated weeks (with a due time of 11:30pm). There will be 10 of these assignments each worth 5 points. Packback questions are due on Wednesdays (PBQ) and responses due that Friday (PBR). No Packback scores will be dropped. Material from questions/responses highlighted in class will be included on quizzes and exams.
Students will start the course with full credit for Packback participation. Failure to upload a unique question and/or responses will result in that full assignment points being deducted. That is; if any portion of the assignment is incomplete or late the score for that entire assignment will be 0/5points. Restating another students question/response will also result in the full assignment points being deducted.

Points possible: Highest 3 exam scores: 3 at 100 pts. each Case Studies: 4 at 25 pts. each Highest 5 quiz scores: 5 at 20 pts. each Highest 5 discuss.ques. scores: 5 at 10 pts.each Packback questions and responses: 10 at 5pts each Total Points

= 300 pts = 100 pts = 100 pts = 50 pts = 50 pts
600 pts

Letter Grades: A = 93.0 - 100% B = 83.0-86.9% C = 73.0-76.9%

A- = 90.0 -92.9% B- = 80.0-82.9% C- = 70.0-72.9%

B+ = 87.0-89.9% C+ = 77.0-79.9% D = 50.01-69.9%

Extra Credit:The decision to offer extra credit is at the discretion of course instructor. If extra credit is offered any opportunity to earn extra points will be fairly offered to all students in the course. Individual requests for extra credit and requests for extra credit after final day of instruction will not be considered.
Late Policy: Any assignment not received when it is due will be recorded as a zero (with the exception of reasons related to an excused absence).
Regrade Policy: Any student may submit a request for a regrade of an assignment within one week of assignment being available for review. These exact timelines will be announced on eLC. Regrade request forms will be available on eLC for students to download. Students may need to pick-up/review their graded assignment with their TA before a regrade request form may be submitted.

LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION: Strong letters of recommendation come from referring students who we know well. Students who are considering requesting letters of recommendation should meet regularly with Dr. Scott and their TA throughout the entire semester or in the several months preceding a letter request. Decisions on letters of recommendation take into consideration a student's overall course grade, how well we know the student, and number of students requesting letters.
**This syllabus is intended as an outline for the course. Some deviations may be necessary. If any changes occur students will be notified immediately.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: Excerpt from A Culture of Honesty: "No student shall perform, attempt to perform, or assist another in performing any act of dishonesty on academic work to be submitted for academic credit or advancement. A student does not have to intend to violate the honesty policy to be found in violation. For example, plagiarism, intended or unintended, is a violation of this policy" Additionally, students must agree that " I will be academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate the dishonest of others."
A complete description of academic dishonesty may be found at http://www.uga.edu/honesty and in the student honor code. If a student is found in violation of the academic integrity policy the University's policy and procedures for handling cases of suspected dishonesty can be found at http://www.uga.edu/ovpi
FINAL EXAMINATION: Cumulative final exam is scheduled for Friday Dec. 6th, 12-3pm

MLC Room 267
Instructor: Laura Fletcher Office: Room 511 - Psychology Building Office hours: By appointment. Please email me to set up a time. Email: lmfletch@uga.edu
Required Text Yantis, Steven. (2014) Sensation and Perception, First ed., New York, NY: Worth Publishers.
Course Description: UGA Bulletin: How organisms sense and perceive the environment. Topics discussed are anatomy and physiology of the sensory systems, types of stimuli affecting sensory systems, and current knowledge and theories of our perceptual abilities.
Additional Information: Lectures and readings will include information about the visual, auditory, olfactory (smell), gustatory (taste), somatosensory (touch), and vestibular systems. We will talk about the interplay of each of these systems with our daily functioning, as well as what happens when our sensory systems fail.
Prerequisites PSYC 1101 & PSYC 2990 or PSYC 3990
Assignments & Exams:
Short Papers (20%): Throughout the semester you will write three short papers (1-2 pages), which relate to broad topics in the course. Specific instructions for these papers will be given separately.
In-class Activities (20%): This course lends itself to demonstrations and hands-on activities. Periodically we will be doing activities in class to help you gain a deeper understanding of the course material. There will be a strict no make-up policy for these assignments, but you may miss three without any penalty to your grade.
Exams (60%): A total of four exams will be administered over the course of the semester. The main purpose of the exams is to evaluate your comprehension of foundational course material, primarily through short-answer questions. Although the exams are not cumulative, information that you learn in one unit is likely to be relevant and valuable to your understanding of material in a subsequent unit. There is a strict no-make up policy for exams. If you do miss an exam, medical or other University-approved documentation of the emergency is required and your missing grade will be replaced with the average of the other three exams.

Grading: Note: a grade of C or better (73% or higher) is required to earn credit as a PSYC major

A grade of incomplete is only assigned in extremely unusual circumstances. Such situations require extensive documentation and approval of faculty supervisors. It is only an option if a student is passing the class and is typically only awarded when a student has completed the majority of the classwork and is only missing one or two exams or assignments. If a grade of incomplete is approved, a written plan for completion of the coursework must be developed by the instructor and student and approved by the faculty supervisor.

Academic Honesty: As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty," and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: www.uga.edu/honesty. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.

Disabilities: If you have a disability that requires further attention, please see the instructor or teaching assistant as soon as possible, so that appropriate accommodations can be made. For further assistance, please contact Disability Services.

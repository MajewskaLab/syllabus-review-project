Course Overview
Food, foe, friend: animals play all these roles, and more, in their relationship to humans, in the past as well as the present. Zooarchaeology is the study of animal remains (bones, teeth, and shells) in the archaeological record. This course will explore how zooarchaeology allows us to reconstruct ancient human-animal-environmental interactions and will cover a range of topics and analytical techniques. The course will be separated into three parts consisting of 14 modules in total. Each module will be 1 week in length with the exception of the first and last modules.
Learning Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: 1. Identify the basic components of animal skeletons/remains found at archaeological sites
2. Be able to read, synthesize, and evaluate zooarchaeological literature within the broader context of ongoing research and with reference to a broad range of topics
3. Have a strong command of the possible applications and relevance of zooarchaeological research for the study of the collective human past as well as present and future
Textbook
The textbook is "An Introduction to Zooarchaeology" by Diane Gifford-Gonzalez. A PDF version of the book is on eLC. Additional readings will also be included and will be uploaded on eLC.

Assessments and Grading

Exams (300 points)
You will have the opportunity to demonstrate your comprehension of the course learning objectives through three exams worth 100 points each. The first two exams will be available for 24 hours on September 24 (Module 5) and October 29 (Module 10). The final exam will be available throughout the final exam period, December 11-17. You will have 3 hours to complete each exam once you have started and you can only submit one attempt.
Quizzes (150 points)
In modules without exams (Modules 1-4, 6-9, 11-13) there will be one quiz, for a total of 11 quizzes. These quizzes are specifically related to the readings to ensure that we are all "on the same page". Each quiz has five questions for a total of 15 points per quiz. The quizzes will be released each Monday at 12:00 AM and are due Thursday evening by 11:59 PM. It is recommended that you complete the quizzes as you do the readings. They are not timed, but you can only submit one attempt. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped for a total of 10 graded quizzes.

Assignments (140 points)
During each module, you will complete an assignment related to the course material: this includes exercises such as video responses, brief essays, carrying out online research, creating a presentation, or participating in a practical exercise. Assignments will be released each Monday at 12:00 AM and are due Tuesday evening by 11:59 PM. Each assignment is worth 10 points.
Forum Posts (60 points)

In order to foster a classroom experience online, you must make at least two posts per module in the forum, plus an initial introduction during the first module, for a total of 28 posts worth 2 points each (56 points) and the introduction worth 4 points. Out of the total of 28 posts, everyone should initiate at least 3 "topic" posts themselves. The other posts may be responses to classmate's posts throughout the semester (and you can comment more than once on a single topic). Furthermore, posts should be somewhat substantive (i.e. more than one sentence) and on-topic.
Late/Makeup Policy
I generally do not accept late assignments or quizzes or allow makeups. Due to the online nature of the course, it is important to try and keep on schedule, or you may quickly fall behind. All quizzes, assignments, and tests are available for an extended period of time with recommended and required completion deadlines. However, on the last day of the class I will allow each student to either submit an assignment that they missed the first time around OR re-do an assignment if they feel they can improve it. There are no late or makeup quizzes or exams.

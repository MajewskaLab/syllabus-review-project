WILD 4060-6060, Field Ornithology Tentative Lecture Schedule, Spring 2010 Lecture: 11:15 - 12:05 MW Lab: Fri 08:00-12:05 Instructor: Robert J. Cooper, For. Res. 3-409, Phone:2-6066 rcooper@warnell.uga.edu Teaching assistant: Anna Joy Lehmicke For. Res. 4-224. e-mail: lehmickea@warnell.uga.edu

Course Objectives: To familiarize students with avian biology, including anatomy and physiology, behavior, ecology, evolution, and conservation. Lab exercises will emphasize taxonomy and identification of North American birds through use of field labs and study skins.

Texts: Required: (1) Gill, Frank B. 1995. Ornithology. Third edition. W. H. Freeman and Co. (2) A field guide. I recommend Peterson, Roger T. 1980. A field guide to the birds of eastern and central North America. Fourth edition. Houghton Mifflin. Or Sibley, David A. The Sibley Field Guide to Birds of Eastern North America. Knopf. (paperback).

Grading: Your grade will be based on a total of 600 points, split between two lecture exams (100 points each), a final exam (100 points), two laboratory exams (100 points each), and a research paper (100 points).

Paper: Each student, or a team of two students, will work independently on a research project focusing on a topic of their choice (start thinking now!). A 1-2 page proposal, outlining the nature of the question, preliminary review of literature, and methods will be turned in by Monday, February 1. Students will present project results in a paper (due 29 April), which will be in proper scientific format (see major ornithological journals such as Auk or Condor for format). Papers are to be typed, double-spaced and include clearly presented results in text, figures and tables. Examples will be provided.

Note that many but not all field trips leave from Whitehall Forest. Also note that lab times differ from week to week. Lab times are subject to change. I will remind you of lab and exam times, but you are ultimately expected to be at the correct place on time or you will be left behind.

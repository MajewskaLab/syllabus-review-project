BIOL 1108 - Principles of Biology II - Spring 2021
Instructor: Dr. Jessica Barb 4514 Miller Plant Sciences Email: jessica.barb@uga.edu (Do NOT email through eLC) Telephone: 706-542-9977 Office hours: Wed and Friday 3-4PM (in person or by zoom) or by appointment just email me
Lecture: T/R 12:45-2:00PM 0085 Science Learning Center or 3:55-5:10PM 400 Chemistry
Prerequisite: BIOL 1107 and BIOL 1107L or BIOL 2107H and BIOL 2107L
The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.
Course format and attendance policy: This course is a hybrid asynchronous course. Meaning there will be BOTH in-person socially-distanced face-to-face instruction once a week and asynchronous recorded lectures. Half of the class is invited to attend class on Tuesday and half of the class is invited to attend class on Thursday. You will be assigned which day (Tuesday or Thursday) based on your last name. Students with a last name starting with A-J come on Tuesdays and students with a last name starting with K-Z come on Thursdays. You can ONLY come in person on the day that is assigned to you, so that we can provide a socially distanced environment in the classroom. If a student would prefer to attend this once a week in-person class remotely they can do so (BUT ONLY ON THURSDAYS) using the zoom link on eLC. This link is available to everyone regardless of your assigned day (based on your last name).
Course organization: Each week will follow a similar pattern:  Asynchronous recorded lectures will be posted on eLC on Thursdays prior to the start of the week.  A reading quiz covering these recorded lectures will be posted the next day (on Fridays) but the deadline
isn't until Wed at 11:59PM.  On Tuesday before class I will post the weekly in-class assignment on eLC for everyone, which will be due
via eLC on Thursdays by 11:59PM. I will print paper copies of these assignments to give to any of the students attending class in person who want them, but the actual assignment must be uploaded via eLC as a word or pdf document. Photos of a paper copy will not be accepted.  On Thursday night I will post a short weekly quiz that will be due by Friday at 11:59PM.

Exams: Unit exams will be given on-line through eLC during your regularly scheduled class period (either 12:452PM OR 3:55-5:10PM). Exam dates are Thursday 2/18 and 3/11 and Tuesday 4/6. The final exam will be given on-line through eLC on Tuesday May 11 from 12:00-3PM for section 20292 and on Tuesday May 11 from 3:30-6:30PM for section 56934. Please let me know in advance if you are going to miss an exam. Missing exams without prior notification and/or an approved reason will result in a zero grade for that exam.

Grades: A-F +/- scale: A = 100-93%, A- = 92-90%, B+ = 89-87%, B = 86-83%, B- = 82-80%, C+ = 79-77%, C = 7673%, C- = 72-70%, D = 69-60%, F = less than 60%.

Grades will be based on reading quizzes (17.2%), weekly quizzes (8.6%), in-class assignments/attendance (8.6%), SimBio labs (13.8%), and 3 unit exams and one non-cumulative final (each worth 12.93%, total 51.7%).

Reading quizzes: There will be 12 reading quizzes that you will complete on eLC. Each reading quiz will be worth 10 pts. Only 10 will count toward your grade, which means you can drop/miss two (2) and still earn up to full credit (100 pts).

Weekly quizzes: There will be 12 weekly quizzes that you will complete on eLC. Each weekly quiz will be worth 5 points. The weekly quizzes will open at 11:59PM on Thursdays and must be completed by 11:59pm on Friday. You will have a set time limit (TBD) in which you have to start and finish this quiz - probably 15 minutes. Only 10 weekly quizzes will count toward your grade, which means you can miss/drop two (2) and still earn full credit (50 pts).

SibBio labs: There will be 4 SimBio labs each will be worth 20 points each and all will count, none can be dropped. SimBio labs are the ONLY assignment that will be accepted after the due date, but they will be penalized 20% and no credit will be given after 3 days past the due date.

eLC: Instructional materials will be posted on eLC throughout the semester and will be the primary way that I will distribute information. I strongly recommend that set your eLC preferences to text you with updates if you don't check your email on a twice daily (AM and PM) basis.

OpenStax Biology (2nd Edition): Free textbook that will be used for some reading assignments. This resource can be found at https://openstax.org/details/books/biology-2e.

Peer Learning Assistants: The 12:45-2PM section will have PLAs to help during in-class activities and for help outside of class.

Disabilities: Reasonable accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities upon approval. For more information about disabilities or to apply for an accommodation, contact the Disability Resource Center at (706) 542-8719 or https://drc.uga.edu. Inquiries are confidential.

Communication: To comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, all interactions regarding personal information such as grades and disabilities must be in person or through a UGA account. Instructors cannot use any other form of communication to discuss personal information.

Academic Dishonesty: The class will follow UGA's policy on academic dishonesty. Anyone suspected of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of Students Office. You are expected to practice academic integrity in every aspect of this course and all other courses. Students who engage in academic misconduct are subject to university disciplinary procedures, as well as consequences with regard to this course.

Cheating on an exam, assignment, quiz will result in a score of zero for that exam, assignment, quiz. Students who attempt to earn points for an in class assignment for which they are not physically present will lose their inclass points for the entire semester.
UGA Student Honor Code: "I will be academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others." A Culture of Honesty, the University's policy and procedures for handling cases of suspected dishonesty, can be found at www.uga.edu/ovpi.
Some forms of academic dishonesty:
Obtaining unauthorized information. Information is obtained dishonestly, for example, by copying graded homework assignments from another student, by working with another student on a take-home test or homework when not specifically permitted to do so by the instructor, by looking at your notes or other written work during an examination when not specifically permitted to do so, or obtaining work from an online homework or exam warehouse.
Tendering of information. Students may not give or sell their work to another person who plans to submit it as his or her own. This includes giving their work to another student to be copied, sharing work when the instructor's directions were that work be completed independently, giving someone answers to exam questions during the exam, taking an exam and discussing its contents with students who will be taking the same exam, or giving or selling a term paper to another student.
Misrepresentation. Students misrepresent their work by handing in the work of someone else. Examples include: purchasing a paper from a term paper service; reproducing another person's paper, project, research, or examination (even with modifications) and submitting it as their own; having another student do their computer program, complete their design project, or complete their online quiz.
Bribery. Offering money or any item or service to a faculty member or any other person to gain academic advantage for yourself or another is dishonest.
Plagiarism. Unacknowledged use of the information, ideas, or phrasing of other writers is an offense comparable with theft and fraud, and it is so recognized by the copyright and intellectual work laws. Plagiarism is the act of representing directly or indirectly another person's work as your own. It can involve presenting someone's speech, wholly or partially, as yours; quoting without acknowledging the true source of the quoted material; copying and handing in another person's work with your name on it; and similar infractions. Even indirect quotations, paraphrasing, etc., can be considered plagiarism unless sources are properly cited. Students will receive a failing grade on the assignment for a first violation. Second violations will result in an F in the course and will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct and face additional academic penalties.

Mental Health and Wellness Resources:  If you or someone you know needs assistance, you are encouraged to contact Student Care and Outreach in the Division of Student Affairs at 706-542-7774 or visit https://sco.uga.edu. They will help you navigate any difficult circumstances you may be facing by connecting you with the appropriate resources or services.

Coronavirus Information for Students

Face Coverings: As a reminder, the University of Georgia--along with all University System of Georgia (USG) institutions-- requires all faculty, staff, students, and visitors to wear an appropriate face covering while inside campus facilities/buildings where six feet social distancing may not always be possible. Anyone not using a face covering when required will be asked to wear one or must leave the area. Reasonable accommodations may be made for those who are unable to wear a face covering for documented health reasons. Students seeking an accommodation related to face coverings should contact Disability Services at https://drc.uga.edu/

DawgCheck: Please perform a quick symptom check each weekday on DawgCheck--on the UGA app or website--whether you feel sick or not. It will help health providers monitor the health situation on campus: https://dawgcheck.uga.edu/

What do I do if I have symptoms? Students showing symptoms should self-isolate and schedule an appointment with the University Health Center by calling 706-542-1162 (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.). Please DO NOT walk-in. For emergencies and afterhours care, see https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies.

What do I do if I test positive? Any student with a positive COVID-19 test is required to report the test in DawgCheck and should self-isolate immediately. Students should not attend classes in-person until the isolation period is completed. Once you report the positive test through DawgCheck, UGA Student Care and Outreach will follow up with you.

What do I do if I am notified that I have been exposed?

Revised Guidelines for COVID-19 Quarantine Period Effective Jan. 4, 2021, students who learn they have been directly exposed to COVID-19 but are not showing symptoms should self-quarantine for 10 days (consistent with updated Department of Public Health (DPH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines). Those quarantining for 10 days must have been symptom-free throughout the monitoring period. Please correspond with your instructor via email, with a cc: to Student Care & Outreach at sco@uga.edu, to coordinate continuing your coursework while self-quarantined.

We strongly encourage students to voluntarily take a COVID-19 test within 48 hours of the end of the 10-day quarantine period (test to be administered between days 8 and 10). Students may obtain these tests at Legion Field (https://clia.vetview.vet.uga.edu/) or at the University Health Center by calling 706-542-1162 (MondayFriday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.). Please DO NOT walk-in the University Health Center without an appointment. For emergencies and after-hours care, see https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies

If the test is negative, the individual may return to campus, but MUST continue to closely monitor for any new COVID-19 symptoms through 14 days. DawgCheck is the best method for monitoring these symptoms. If new symptoms occur, the individual must not come to campus and must seek further testing/evaluation.

If the test is positive at the end of the 10-day period, the individual must begin a 10-day isolation period from the date of the test.
How do I participate in surveillance testing if I have NO symptoms?
We strongly encourage you to take advantage of the expanded surveillance testing that is being offered from January 4 - 22: up to 1,500 free tests per day at Legion Field and pop-up locations. Testing at Legion Field can be scheduled at https://clia.vetview.vet.uga.edu/. Walk-up appointments can usually be accommodated at Legion Field, and pop-up saliva testing does not require pre-registration. For planning purposes, precise sites and schedules for the pop-up clinics are published on the UHC's website and its social media as they are secured: https://www.uhs.uga.edu/healthtopics/covid-surveillance-testing.

Description: This course will provide an introduction to cognitive neuroscience - the study of how the brain enables the mind. Following a brief overview of neuroanatomy, current cognitive neuroscience methods will be described, and several disciplines of study within the field of cognitive neuroscience will be introduced. Upon completion of this course, students should be familiar with the major areas of cognitive neuroscience research, understand the basic strengths and weaknesses of different cognitive neuroscience methods, and should understand the advantage of using converging research methods to address a particular research question.

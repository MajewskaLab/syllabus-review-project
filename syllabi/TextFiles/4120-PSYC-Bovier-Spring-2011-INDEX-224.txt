REQUIRED TEXT Foley, H.J., & Matlin, M.W. (2010). Sensation and Perception, 5th ed. Boston, MA: Allyn & Bacon.
COURSE DESCRIPTION From UGA Bulletin: How organisms sense and perceive the environment. Topics discussed are anatomy and physiology of the sensory systems, types of stimuli affecting sensory systems, and current knowledge and theories of our perceptual abilities.
Additional Information: This course will focus on how the anatomy and physiology of each sensory system allows organisms to understand their environment. Information regarding the interplay between sensory systems and consequences of dysfunction/sensory deficits will also be covered. Throughout the semester, we will explore several interesting and exciting sensory phenomena, such as:
Visual Illusions: What is the moon illusion?
Music Perception: Why do we hear some songs as "angry" or "sad"?
Phantom Limbs: How is it that amputees still feel their lost limbs?
Pain and Pleasure: What in the world is so pleasurable about getting a tattoo?
Taste & Smell Preference: How does sensory perception of food affect our appetite?
Sensory Disorders & Deficits : Is it possible to "hear" color?
You will also have an opportunity to choose your own topics of interest to focus on in class.
PREREQUISITES PSYC 1101 PSYC 2990 or PSYC 3990

ASSIGNMENTS & EXAMS
Response Papers (20% of total grade): Please see additional handout regarding the specifics of Response Papers. You will complete a total of three response papers throughout the semester. The goal of this activity is to provide you an opportunity to develop writing skills and explore interesting psychological phenomena.

Readiness Assessment and Active Learning Activities (20% of total grade): Your readiness to participate in class will be assessed through a variety of activitietechniques (e.g., minute papers). You will also participate in active learning activities throughout the semester. Participation in these activities will count as your attendance grade. A total of 18 in-class activities will be completed throughout the course of the semester. There is a strict no make-up policy. You will be allowed to miss 3 activities without penalty to your grade. All class materials will be accessible via eLC, however no make-up assessments will be made for attendance. The course material lends itself well to hands-on experience, in addition to lecture. The goal of the activities is to encourage learning on a deeper level. They will also provide an opportunity for you to interact with peers, receive peer feedback, and brainstorm theories related to course material and your own scientific interests.

Exams (60% of total grade): A total of four exams will be administered over the course of the semester. The main purpose of the exams is to evaluate your comprehension of foundational course material, primarily through short-answer questions. Although the exams are not cumulative, information that you learn in one unit is likely to be relevant and valuable to your understanding of material in a subsequent unit. There is a strict no-make up policy for exams. If you do miss an exam, medical or other documentation of the emergency is required and your missing grade will be replaced with the average of the other three exams.

GRADES Note: a grade of C or better (73% or higher) is required to earn credit as a PSYC major.

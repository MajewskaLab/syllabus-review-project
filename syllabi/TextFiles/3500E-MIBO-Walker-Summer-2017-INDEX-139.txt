Welcome to an overview of the microbial world. Microorganisms' (particularly bacteria) structure, function, diversity, and importance to man will be the focus of this course. The course will focus on applying knowledge and honing scientific reasoning skills. Case scenarios and sample problems that could occur in real life will stretch collective knowledge and encourage critical thought.

Course Syllabus
REQUIRED TEXTBOOKS AND TECHNOLOGY
Microbiology, An Evolving Science by Joan L. Slonczewski and John W. Foster, Third Edition, Hardcover ISBN 978-0393919295 Students may purchase/rent whatever copy (hardbound, binder, ebook) that is affordable as long as they acquire the 3rd edition of this textbook

CLASS PROCEDURES
DUE DATES, FEEDBACK AND REQUEST FOR REGRADE All due dates/times are listed in the syllabus are final. Assignments, exams or activities turned in after the due date/time WILL NOT be accepted and be scored as a zero. As a courtesy, all assignment/activity due dates and exam dates will be embedded in the course on eLC. All dates and times are in Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDS)
Grades and feedback for online quizzes will be returned immediately after the due date. For group activities and exams, grades and feedback will be returned within five (5) days.
Request for a regrade of an exam, homework assignment, or activity must be submitted within 3 DAYS (not including weekends) after grade posting wherein the ENTIRE exam, homework or activity will be regraded. To request a regrade, students must submit via email (to mibo3500online@uga.edu) the question number, their answer with supporting evidence that proves the answer is correct. Supporting evidence can be from the textbook or a peer-reviewed article (not a blog entry, Wikipedia or a Facebook post).
COMMUNICATION EXPECTATIONS Students are expected to check the eLC News widget daily for course announcements - I prefer to communicate with all students using this tool, rather than mass email. I suggest students subscribe to receive automatic email alerts when a news item is posted. In eLC, there's a drop-down menu beneath your name: profile, notifications, and account settings preferences. You can make this adjustment under account settings.
-For personal issues/concerns, students should communicate with the instructor via the UGA email: mibo3500online@uga.edu.

Syllabus
-Course material questions should be posted to the eLC Discussion Board or emailed to the instructor and TAs at mibo3500onlineuga.edu. Posting content questions and responses here benefits everyone in the class. For each post (question, comment, or reply to a comment), you have the option of your post showing your name, or choosing to have your post made "anonymously" under a randomly assigned board nickname. (Your assigned "anonymous" nickname will remain the same all term.)

EXAMS, QUIZZES, AND GROUP ACTIVITIES
Exams
Exams will be given via the eLC quiz tool. You will have a set amount of time once you open the exam to complete it - you will not be able to start/stop the exam timer. You must ensure you have a stable Internet connection before you begin the exam - if you are disconnected, you WILL NOT be able to re-open the exam. All exams are closed book. Access of information during exam or observing someone else taking the exam is a violation of academic honesty and will be reported. Exams must be submitted in a timely manner. If an exam is submitted past the time limit it will not be graded and will be counted as a 0. There are NO MAKE-UP exams - instead, your lowest exam grade will be omitted. Your final exam cannot count as your dropped exam
Module quizzes
Module quizzes are online quizzes that preview upcoming material of the next module that must be answered and submitted INDIVIDUALLY. These timed quizzes are based on the learning objectives outlined in the respective module. Students may take the quizzes two times. The first submission of answers will show whether or not credit was earned for the answer submitted. The second submission will be graded and recorded in the grade book with correct answers posted after the due date. Quizzes may be taken with notes and/or textbook and may be submitted at any time on eLC up until the deadline posted.
Group activities
At the beginning of the semester, students are randomly arranged into groups. Group activities are offered throughout the semester. Students will collaborate within groups to create a consensus of answers to the group activity questions based on discussions in class. Each student will individually submit activity answers to the group discussion board, worth up to 10 points. Please see the individual answer rubric for grading guidelines in the "Welcome, Start Here" folder. Groups will discuss via discussion board to create a collective answer for each group question. To earn the other 15 points, answers will be submitted through the group activity quiz feature on eLC and be graded according to correct answers. Failure to submit substantive individual answers to the discussion board will result in a zero (0) for the entire activity.
Course schedule
Please see the document labeled "Course Schedule" for all assignments and due dates.

Syllabus
640 points are available for the course. eLC's gradebook will be used for official grade calculations.

Module quizzes: 9 quizzes, 10 pts each = 90 pts

Group Activity: 4 activities, 25 pts each = 100 pts

Exams (Best 3 out of 4): 3 exams, 100 pts each = 300 pts

Final Exam: 150 pts

Total: 640 pts

Your final course percentage and letter grade will be calculated by this formula: [(Total points)/640] x 100 = Course percentage

LETTER GRADE ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE MADE ACCORDING TO YOU COURSE PERCENTAGE ON THE FOLLOWING SCALE:

A = (4.0) = 92.45-100%

A- = (3.7) = 89.45 - 92.44%

B+ = (3.3) = 86.45- 89.44%

B = (3.0) = 82.45 - 86.44%

B- = (2.7) = 79.45 - 82.44%

C+ = (2.3) = 76.45 - 79.44%

C = (2.0) = 72.45- 76.44%

C- = (1.7) = 69.45 - 72.44%

D = (1.0) = 59.45 - 69.44%

F = (0.0) = 59.44% OR BELOW

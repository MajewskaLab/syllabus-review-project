KINS 4690/6690: Fall 2022

Course Syllabus

Neuromuscular Physiology

Neuromuscular Physiology: KINS 4690 / 6690
Instructor: Owais Khan

Meeting: Room 202, Ramsey Center (face-to-face format)
Monday + Wednesday + Friday, 12.40pm - 1.30pm

Course Description: This course aims to provide an overview of the structure (functional anatomy), function (physiology) and clinical relevance (pathology, pathophysiology) of skeletal muscles. For ease of communication and simplicity, the course content is divided into two sections, namely (1) skeletal muscle structure and function, and (2) applied skeletal muscle physiology related to exercise, illness and disease.

Course Theme: The division mentioned above is superficial at best; throughout the course, the pre-eminent focus will be on exploring a common theme: form follows function.
"Whether it be the sweeping eagle in his flight, or the open apple-blossom, the toiling workhorse, the blithe swan, the branching oak, the winding stream at its base, the drifting clouds, over all the coursing sun, form ever follows function, and this is the law. Where
function does not change, form does not change" - Architect Louis Sullivan
Course Prerequisites: None, although some exposure to basic college-level biology/anatomy/physiology may help.
Course Instructor: Owais Ahmed Khan (he/him/his)- I prefer Owais (pronounced Oh-ways), or simply Mr. `O' Office: Ramsey Centre - Room 348 owais.khan@uga.edu  this is my preferred means of communication, please do not send me emails via eLC as these do not show up as notifications on my inbox! Phone: 706-773-9229
Office Hours: By appointment - please email me at the campus email above to set up a meeting. I also plan to be present in the classroom 15-20 minutes before class starts, and 15-20 minutes following the end of each class. Please drop in with questions, doubts or just to say hello and chat about your day 
Course Attendance: Attendance for all class sessions is mandatory. If for some reason you cannot attend a specific class session in-person, please email me with a valid reason for your absence before noon (12:00pm) on the day of the class. Once I approve your absence, I may provide you with a copy of the lecture video. Class participation comprises 20% of your final grade, so unexcused absences can severely impact your grade!
Course Textbook: None required, all course material will be provided via eLC. Supplementary (optional) textbooks for this course: 1. Skeletal Muscle Structure, Function, and Plasticity - by Richard L. Lieber - 3rd Edition. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins (2009)  This richly detailed book is an excellent resource on muscle function, with emphasis on relevance to rehab (PT/OT) and clinical practice. 2. Skeletal Muscle: Form and Function - by MacIntosh, Gardiner, McComas - 1st or 2nd Edition  Provides excellent line drawings and illustrations that complement course material.
NOTE: Please let me know if you have difficulty obtaining any reading material or textbook!

IMPORTANT: Teaching Philosophy and Extra Credits My teaching philosophy can be summarized as follows:

Philosophy 1: Ensure all students receive ample opportunities to demonstrate their grasp of concepts and course material.
How I will practice this: (a) Bonus questions on quizzes will allow you to make up for dropped points (b) Flexible drop: You are allowed to drop one (1) scheduled quiz AND one (1) class quiz from your final grade. No explanation is needed - life happens and I get it. (c) Different assessment methods will be used for class quizzes, like writing reflections, drawing activities, answering questions out loud, explaining concepts to fellow students etc.

Philosophy 2: Ensure students receive ample opportunities to communicate with colleagues and peers, build relationships and support each other throughout the course.
How I will practice this: (a) Classroom participation has been given equal importance (20% total grade) as quizzes and mid-/end-term evaluations. I aim to provide you the opportunity to voice your opinions, share your experiences and get to know your peers through classroom discussion. (b) Opportunities for team-based, collaborative submissions for the end-term project will be provided. I encourage you to collaborate with people from outside your lab / field of expertise, so you can develop an appreciation for interdisciplinary team-work. (c) Class interactions and quizzes. I aim to provide different avenues for expression, depending on your learning preference and comfort with communication.

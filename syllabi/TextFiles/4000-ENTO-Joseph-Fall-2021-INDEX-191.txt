Text Book: Daly and Doyen's Introduction to Insect Biology and Diversity. Third Edition. 2012. J. B. Whitfield and A.H. Purcell III
Supplemental Reading Material: Triplehorn, C.A. and N.F. Johnson. 2005. Borror and DeLong's Introduction to the Study of Insects. 7th ed. Thomson Brooks/Cole, Belmont CA, 864 pp.
Course Objectives: The goal of this course is to make you familiar with the fundamentals of insect biology and relationships among insects, plants and other organisms. It will also introduce you to the different specialization within the field of entomology including agriculture, medical and veterinary, apiculture, etc. We hope to give you an appreciation for the diversity of form and function in the insect world by presenting both beneficial and detrimental effects of insects. Hopefully, you will leave this course with a better understanding of how insects affect all other forms of life on the planet.
Laboratory Objectives: In the laboratory, you will learn how to identify commonly encountered insects. We will introduce basic elements of insect morphology and taxonomy. Learning to distinguish unique features of insects will also allow an increased appreciation for insect diversity and a sense of where insects fit in to the animal kingdom.

Attendance: Students are expected to attend class on a regular basis in person or via zoom. If absent from class, it is the responsibility of the student to make up any work that is missed. Grades will be based on the following items:
1. Lecture Exams (3) 2. Laboratory Quizzes (5) 3. Laboratory Exams (2) 4. Insect Collection (1)

Lecture Exams -----------------------------------------------------------------------There will be three lecture exams including the final exam, each worth 100 points for ENTO 4000. Exams will be given in class and will test your knowledge of the material presented during the lecture portion of the class. The first two lecture exams will be given during the semester while the third will serve as the final exam for the course. Students registered for ENTO 6000 will have additional 25 points of questions for each exam. These questions usually will involve an essay-type answer.

Laboratory Quizzes -----------------------------------------------------------------------You will be given five - 10 point quizzes that will be worth a total of 50 points. Quizzes will be administered at the beginning of five labs and will cover insect taxonomy.

Laboratory Exams -----------------------------------------------------------------------There will be two laboratory exams worth 50 points. These exams will test your knowledge of the material presented in the laboratory during the course of the semester.

Insect Collection -----------------------------------------------------------------------You will be required to make an insect collection that will be turned in for grading at the end of the semester. This collection will be worth a total of 100 points. Details on collection requirements and grading will be presented in laboratory.

Grading Policies -----------------------------------------------------------------------First, a review of point values for each required item in the course:

Calculating a Grade 1. Add total points accumulated and divide by 550 (the maximum possible number of points for ENTO 4000) and convert to a percentage.

2. Calculate grade, based on percentage distribution presented below In the example above, the Ent 400 student had 475/550 points, which is rounded to 86%. This is a "B". Plus and minus grades also will be applied according to UGA guidelines.

Table for Finals Grades Course Percentages (Approximate) A 90-100% B 80-89%
C 70-79% D 60-69% F <60%

Required Textbook: Sensation and Perception, 10th Edition by E. Bruce Goldstein; James R. Brockmole
Course Description: This course will cover how organisms sense and perceive the environment. Topics discussed are anatomy and physiology of the sensory systems, types of stimuli affecting sensory systems, and current knowledge and theories of our perceptual abilities.
Exams: Students will complete five exams, with the final exam being cumulative from all course material covered this semester. The best four of those five exam grades will count toward your final grade and the lowest grade will be dropped. Exams will consist of multiple choice and short answer format questions. Questions will be based on material from class discussions, lectures, readings, activities, and any supplementary resources offered (e.g., eLC material, videos, guest speakers).
Missing an exam: Make-up exams will not be given. One of the five exam grades will be dropped, so if unexpected circumstances should arise causing you to miss an exam, you may drop that grade. I do not advise that you plan to drop an exam. Arriving late to an exam: You will have the designated class period to complete your exam, even if you arrive late. You will not be allowed to take the exam if you arrive after the first person has turned in the exam.
Participation/Writing Assignments: Short writing assignments will be assigned throughout the semester. These assignments will relate to the topics covered in class. Writing assignments may be announced during the class period in which they are handed in and cannot be made up.
Final Project: You will be required to complete one group project as a portion of your grade in this course. The projects will be presented in class during the final days of the semester. More information will be provided in class regarding the content of these final projects and their formats.

Final grade: Your final grade will consist of a total of 550 points. These points are composed of the four highest exam grades, each worth 100 points, your participation/writing assignments (together totaling 50 points), and your group project, worth 100 points.

Exam 1: 100 points Exam 2: 100 points Exam 3: 100 points Exam 4: 100 points Final Exam: 100 points Participation/Writing Assignments: 50 points Group project: 100 points Total: 550 points

Letter grades will be assigned according to the following breakdown, with percentage calculated as the

total possible points divided by total number of earned points:

A (92.50% and up)

C+ (77.50 - 79.999%)

A- (90.00 - 92.499%)

C (72.50 - 77.499%)

B+ (87.50 - 89.999%)

Instructor decisions on grades are final, and once posted, grades will not be changed except in cases of clerical error. Please do not ask me to change your grade or give you extra-credit opportunities. Emails requesting grade inflation or extra credit will not receive a response.

Attendance: Attendance to class is expected. You are responsible for all class material and in-class announcements whether you are present or not.

Your presence in class is likely to impact your performance on exams. In addition, your presence in class is required in order to receive credit for participation. Participation assignments will be unannounced and cannot be made up. There will be many of these assignments and two missed participation assignments will be dropped for all students, regardless of the reason for the absence. If extenuating circumstances cause you to miss many classes during the semester, please contact me so that we can discuss your options.

Academic honesty statement: As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty," and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: https://ovpi.uga.edu/academic-honesty/academichonesty-policy. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.

Disability resources: If you need special accommodations for this course, please contact the Disability Resource Center (706542-8719). Inform me of any necessary accommodations as soon as possible.

Withdrawal: The deadline for withdrawing from the course with a grade of withdrawal-passing grade or "WP" is October 17, 2018. A grade of "WP" will only be assigned if the student is passing the course at the time of withdrawal, and only if it conforms to the University of Georgia policy on limited withdrawal-passing grades.

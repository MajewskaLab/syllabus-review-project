Description: This course provides an introduction to the field of infectious disease ecology, an area of study that has developed rapidly over the past three decades and addresses some of the most significant challenges to human health and conservation. Students will obtain an appreciation for the incredible diversity of parasitic organisms, arguably the most abundant life forms on the planet, and examine how parasites invade and spread through host populations. Throughout an emphasis will be placed on providing a quantitative understanding of infectious diseases dynamics at the population level. Students will gain a basic understanding of the population biology of micro- and macroparasites, mechanisms of transmission and causes and consequences of ecological and genetic heterogeneity. Specific topics include types of pathogens and their ecological properties, epidemiology and impacts on host populations, evolution of resistance and virulence, role of ecology and evolution in the emergence of new diseases, parasites in the context of ecological communities, within-host dynamics and the ecology of immunity, population-level consequences of control measures and the role of parasites in biodiversity and conservation.
Class objectives: 1. Provide an understanding of the biology of parasites and infectious diseases,
integrating basic concepts with real-world examples 2. Increase familiarity with quantitative approaches for studying infectious disease
dynamics at the population and community level 3. Review historical development and current research in the field of infectious disease
ecology 4. Enhance appreciation for the taxonomic and biological diversity of parasitic
organisms and host responses to infection 5. Enhance appreciation for the importance of parasites in biodiversity conservation and
management and human health 6. Consider the role of ecology and evolution in predicting disease emergence and
responding to epidemics

Format: The course format includes lecture, discussion of scientific papers, computer assignments and problem sets. Students are expected to attend lectures on a regular basis, complete regular assignments, and prepare for and participate in class discussions.
Prerequisites: This course assumes familiarity with general ecology and biology, and past coursework in calculus, linear algebra and/or statistics.
Attendance: Attendance and class participation are required. Students who miss a class should immediately contact fellow students for lecture notes and assignments, and will be expected to submit assignments at the regular set deadlines. More than 4 unexcused absences from lecture, and 4 unexcused absences from weekly labs/discussion sessions may result in an automatic lowering of the final score by one letter grade.
Assignments: Students are responsible for completing assignments related to computer and data labs, as well as turning in reading summaries during weeks where discussion takes place (explained below) and occasional tasks assigned in lecture. Unless otherwise specified, homework assignments will be due by 5pm on the date specified. Students may turn assignments in during class or in the professor's mailbox in the Ecology building. Unless otherwise specified, all assignments will be due 1 week from the date they are undertaken/set in class. For weeks where a discussion is indicated, you should come to the discussion section with a short (1/2 page) summary of the assigned reading. Instructors reserve the right to penalize late assignments.
Reading materials: Reading material for this course is based on journal articles and book chapters. Lectures will often refer to ideas and results from assigned readings, and exams will cover content from each of the readings. A full reading list is maintained at the end of the syllabus, and papers will be uploaded onto eLC prior to the assigned reading date.
Exams: There will be a mid-term exam on March 10 and a second exam on Thursday April 28. There will also be three in class pop quizzes distributed throughout the semester. You will not be able to make up these quizzes if you miss class.
Grade calculation: 30% Lab assignments and quizzes 30% Mid-term exam 30% Second exam 10% Participation and class discussions
Enrollment in 6150: Students enrolled in the graduate course number will be expected to complete additional problems on assignments and exams that require synthesis of class and reading materials, and will also be expected to lead one discussion session during the spring semester. They will additionally write a 2-page research proposal in the NSF GRFP format and present their research ideas to the class in a short presentation during a class symposium.

Accommodations: Please contact the instructor if you require special accommodations due to learning disabilities, religious practices, physical or medical needs, or for any other reason.
General Notes: (i) All academic work must meet the standards contained in "A Culture of Honesty." Students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work. The link to more detailed information about academic honesty can be found at: http://www.uga.edu/ovpi/honesty/acadhon.htm (ii) The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructors may be necessary.

MIBO/IDIS/POPH 4450-4450L and 6450-6450L MICROBIAL GENETICS: 4 Credit Hours (Microbial Genetics and Genomics)
Course Description: Molecular basis of gene regulation in microorganisms with emphasis on systems pertaining to pathogenesis, evolution, and ecology. Computer lab examines evolutionary relatedness, sequence comparisons, database searches and reconstruction of metabolic pathways.
Expected Learning Outcomes: Students will develop an understanding of bacterial genetic systems and how they relate to important bacterial processes. Students will also develop an understanding for genomic and proteonomic approaches for studying diverse microbial species.
Additional Requirements for Graduate Students: Students taking the course for graduate credit will be given additional assignments associated with the computer lab. Students must also give a classroom lecture pertaining to topic(s) covered in class.
Lecture: Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 1:25-2:15pm, Biological Sciences Bldg., Rm. 216
Computer Lab: Wednesday, 2:30-4:25 pm, Biological Sciences Bldg., Rm. 217. Required
No excused absences from 1abs. Each missed lab results in loss of points from final grade, in accordance to points assigned for that lab(s). A printed lab report is due 2 weeks following each lab or lab module and it is to be turned in at the beginning of lab period. Lab module Identifying Virulence Genes (Lab 13/14) is due Dec. 3.
Grades: A-F
Honor Code and Academic Honesty Policy Students are expected to abide by the University Honor Code and Academic Honesty Policy as described in "A Culture of Honesty." For term papers, problem sets and exams, students are expected to work individually. In the computer lab, some modules may require working in groups but all students are expected to contribute equally to the work. The writing in all lab reports must be original responses from individuals. Any material from books or websites must be acknowledged and referenced.
Prerequisites: Undergraduates- MIBO 3500; Graduate MIBO 3500 or permission of department.
Textbook: Molecular Genetics of the Bacterial Cell 3rd Edition, ASM Press; Washington, D.C. (Required)

 Exams: 100 pts. each; 4 exams; 400 pts., total.  Labs: 14 total lab sessions = 580 pts. Points are assigned to labs based on
continuation/building upon of previous labs and overall difficulty.

Students are required to read material/protocols before each lab period. Your preparation will affect the time necessary in completing the lab for the allotted time period. There is also an expectation by the instructors that students will need to do additional reading and work necessary in completing several of the lab assignments.

 Attendance and class participation: 20 pts.

Exams I-IV: 40% LAB/attendance and class participation: 60%

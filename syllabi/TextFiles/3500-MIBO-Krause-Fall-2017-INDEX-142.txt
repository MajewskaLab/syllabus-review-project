by appointment (contact me at dkrause@uga.edu to arrange day and time) Monday 11:30-1:00 & Wednesday 1:00-2:30 in 808 Biol Sci Bldg Tuesday 10:30-12:00 & Thursday 9:00-10:30 in 548 Biol Sci Bldg

RESOURCES: Textbook: Microbiology: An Evolving Science, Slonczewski et al., 3rd or 4th edition (OPTIONAL)

Lecture PowerPoints: Files are posted on eLC and should not be considered comprehensive. You are strongly encouraged to review each day's material before class. There will be additional details discussed in class that are not included in these files, and so it's important that you attend lecture regularly.

eLC: will include the syllabus, species lists, exam grades, old exams from last year, lecture files, case studies, and after Drop-Add, your case study team assignment.

Updates and Communication: If I need to communicate with the class outside of lecture I will post notices on eLC. To communicate with me please email me directly (dkrause@uga.edu).

Attendance: Students are expected to attend all lectures and are responsible for all material and instructions covered during class. There is no mandatory attendance policy, but there will be material discussed in class that is not in the PowerPoint files on eLC and that will appear on exam questions. Unannounced quizzes are always a possibility.

GRADES: Exams: Tests will focus on material covered in class. There will be 3 in-class exams and a comprehensive final exam. Your lowest score from the four exams will be dropped. Thus, if you are satisfied with your grade from the in-class exams, you might choose not to take the final exam. There are NO MAKE-UP EXAMS. If an exam is missed for any reason, the missed exam will count as your dropped exam. I do make exceptions to this rule under extreme circumstances and for participation in certain UGA-sanctioned events. Contact me if you have questions whether your circumstances might apply.

In the event class is canceled (for example due to weather) on a date when an exam is scheduled or an assignment is due, these will be rescheduled for the first class day back.

Students can review their graded exams during TA office hours. Exams may photographed but not removed from the presence of the TA. Grade appeals for individual exams or assignments must be submitted to a TA by email by the deadline posted after each exam / assignment.

Case Studies: There will be approximately 6 case studies. Students will be randomly assigned to small groups to research and discuss each case study and prepare a single group response for each case study question. Case studies will be discussed in class, with group members asked to share their group's answers. Exams will include questions taken from the case study discussions.

Species Quizzes: There will be 2 CUMULATIVE species quizzes.

Final Course Grade:

Case Study and Species Quiz Totals

25%

Exam average

75%

Assume that grades will be assigned according to the following scale, with no curve. I do round grade averages upward according to normal convention.

B+ 87 - 89

C+ 77 - 79

D

60 - 69

A

93 -100

B

83 - 86

C

73 - 76

F

< 60

A - 90 - 92 B - 80 - 82 C - 70 - 72

For questions about the plus/minus grading, go to this site: http://bulletin.uga.edu/PlusMinusGradingFAQ.html

ACADEMIC HONESTY: As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty", and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: www.uga.edu/honesty <http://www.uga.edu/honesty>. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to the course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor. Be aware that the prohibition of unauthorized assistance includes use of social media for such purposes.

This syllabus is subject to change in the case of unforeseen circumstances during the semester and should be considered a
flexible document.

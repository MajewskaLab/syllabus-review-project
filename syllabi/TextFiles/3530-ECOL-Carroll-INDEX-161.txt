Conservation Biology ECOL 3530, Fall Semester 2009
Course Syllabus Instructors:
Dr. C. Ronald Carroll - rcarroll@uga.edu Dr. Catherine Pringle-cpringle@uga.edu Course description: This 3-credit hour course is an introduction to the rapidly expanding field of conservation biology. We will cover the foundational principles of conservation biology, and use case studies to illustrate these principles in practice. In general, our objective is not for you to memorize an extensive list of names, dates, or equations; rather, our goal is for you to obtain a functional understanding of key concepts, examples, case studies, patterns, and processes in conservation biology. The final course lectures will focus on some major, emerging issues in conservation science. Lecture slides will be posted on the course web site: (http://www.rivercenter.uga.edu/education/3530/fall09.htm). Course textbook:
th
Essentials of Conservation Biology, 4 edition, by Richard B. Primack. Course grading scheme:
Grades will be based on a mid-term exam (25%), a comprehensive final exam (30%), a term paper project (30%), and a series of unannounced short quizzes (15%). The mid-term (Thursday, Oct 8) and final exam (Tuesday, Dec 15) dates are set; under extenuating circumstances, the exam dates can be changed, but you must contact us ASAP to make alternate arrangements. Your term paper will be a critical analysis of a current issue in conservation, such as a pending action under the Endangered Species Act. Further instruction on the term paper will be given out within the first few weeks of class.
You are responsible for all information presented in class, and for all assigned readings (which may include a few in-class assignments, not yet listed below). Reading assignments are shown in the daily syllabus below (bracketed pages); be sure to read each day's assignment prior to class. For each chapter, we recommend that you first read the Summary at the end, then read the chapter to flesh out the key points. Think about the Discussion questions both as you read, and before coming to class. If no reading assignment is listed in the syllabus, you're in the clear for that day. You are also responsible for any material posted on the course website - be sure to check it periodically.

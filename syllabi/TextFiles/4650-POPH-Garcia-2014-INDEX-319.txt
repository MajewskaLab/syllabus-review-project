COURSE OBJECTIVES OR EXPECTED LEARNING OUTCOMES The objective of this course is to familiarize undergraduate and graduate students with the different viral families, their classification, replication, pathogenesis, epidemiology and control of the viral diseases.

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS Graduate students will be required to present the findings of a research paper during 15 minutes oral
presentation. You must submit the paper/topic to Dr. García for approval by 10/24 and the Power point presentation must be submitted to Dr. García by 11/7 for review before it can be presented.

GRADING SYSTEM: Grade Scale: A 100-93, A- 92-90, B+ 89-87, B 86-83, B- 82-80, C+ 79-77, C 76-73, C- 72-70, D+ 6967, D 66-63, D- 62-60, F <60. Note: grades ending in >.5 round up to the next whole number, e.g. 92.6 rounds to 93, but 92.5 counts as 92.

Undergraduates Graduates

3 exams + Final exam = 80% 3 work sheets = 15% Class participation and attendance =5% 3 exams + Final = 70% 3 work sheets = 15% 1 presentation= 10% Class participation = 5%

If you miss an exam (unexcused), that is scored as a zero. Make-up exams for excused absences
must be arranged with the professor giving the exam (see syllabus) well in advance for Universityapproved absences or the day of return from an illness (Doctor's excuse is required for full period of absence). Exams may have a mix of short answer, discussion, multiple choice, and fill-in tables. You must use a pen to take the exams or you cannot request a re-grade. Re-grading must be requested in writing with an explanation of the reason that re-grading is needed within 7 days after the
exam is returned to the class. There will be no individual extra credit (papers or assignments) to improve grades.

READING ASSIGNMENTS: Reading assignments from the required text book, Virology: Molecular Biology and Pathogenesis, L. C. Norkin. ASM Press, are listed on the syllabus. The assigned research articles will be posted on the e-Learning Commons site for the course. For supplementary
readings on lecture topics the text book entitle Basic Virology by Wagner is recommended.

There are no designated office hours for the Instructors; you may set up appointments with the Faculty by e-mail (Please do not just drop by our offices!): Dr. Garcia mcgarcia@uga.edu Dr. Jackwood mjackwoo@uga.edu Dr. He bhe@uga.edu

Power-point slides for each lecture will be posted to the e-Learning Commons (http://elc.uga.edu/). Note that there is significant material covered in lectures that is NOT in the textbook or the posted ppt. Therefore it is essential that you attend lectures and take notes to fully understand the material for this course. Remember, participation in class is 5% of your grade.

All academic work must meet the standards contained in "A Culture of Honesty." Students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work. http://www.uga.edu/ovpi/academic_honesty/academic_honesty.htm
The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.

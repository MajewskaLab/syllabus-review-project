It is essential that students attend all lectures and discussion groups, having completed the required readings and assignments beforehand. Timeliness is expected at all events. Any absence will require a written explanation due no later than the following day, and it is the prerogative of the instructor to consider the absence excused or unexcused, or to request additional information or documentation. The instructor may require an additional assignment for missed events. The small class size provides an unusual opportunity for close student-faculty interactions, and full participation in all events is essential. The following paperback textbook, available at the UGA bookstore (or order on-line), is required by Prof. Anderson and must be purchased in the US

before departure and taken to Cortona: James D. Watson, DNA, The Secret of Life, Alfred A. Knopf, 2003, ISBN-10: 0375710078. He will also provide copies of articles that you must take with you to Cortona for his discussion sections. Prof. Puett will provide each student with a Handbook (H) and a Readings (R) document at orientation; these must also be taken to Cortona. All required daily readings for both lecturers and discussions are given in the Syllabus after the lecture/discussion titles. It is important that all reading and preparation for lectures and group discussions be completed prior to class each day.
BCMB/GENE 3433 is taught using a combination of lectures, group discussions (with full participation and leadership by the students, instructors serving as moderators and facilitators), and four papers to be submitted at the end of the assigned discussion period. The papers should have your name and the title/topic of the paper at the top of the page followed by text (about 500 words). You are encouraged to include a figure(s) and/or table(s) when appropriate, and reference(s), which may be websites visited for information, must be given. The papers should be submitted using single-spaced typing (12 font). There are two Discussion periods, I and II, scheduled most class days from 10:40 am - 12:40 pm. The class is divided into two major groups, A and B, and each of these is sub-divided into four sub-groups, 1-4. For Discussion period I, A meets with Prof. Anderson and B with Prof. Puett; for Discussion period II, the groups exchange, B with Prof. Anderson and A with Prof. Puett. The smaller groups, 1-4, will have specific writing and leadership assignments on various days (see schedule), but all students are expected to be prepared for and to participate in the discussions. Four papers (total) are required of each student. The student group (A or B)/sub-group (1-4) assignments are given below.
A1: Casale, Graham, Lawrence, Rhaesa A2: Edwards, Grochowska, Lee, Simonti A3: Hawkins, Hood, Speros, Tyndall, Yun A4: Hickman, Howard, Melton, Peeples, Tran
B1: James, Kaushish, Miskovic, Veltri B2: Johnson, Morgan T., Nishanova, Wade B3: Kamper, Morgan K., White, Wong B4: Lanier, Marx, Nyhoff, Taylor, Tosini
Final grades will be based on the following @ 33.333% each: (i) Exam 1, (ii) Exam 2, and (iii) papers, attendance, and participation in the discussions and lectures. ______________________________________________________________________________

Student Name c/o The University of Georgia Studies Abroad Program Via Delle Santucce 2 52044 Cortona (AR) ITALY
DO NOT send medications, vitamins, cosmetics, or food (or do not declare them) because Italian Customs have become much stricter on such imports. Every time contents such as these are seen on a packing list, they make sanitary inspection or food inspection and charge at least 30-40 euro per package. Do not declare value over $50, and state that the articles are used and for personal use while in Italy. This should help avoid high duty pricing. There will be always exceptions, but the program hopes to make it easier and less expensive for the students and faculty.

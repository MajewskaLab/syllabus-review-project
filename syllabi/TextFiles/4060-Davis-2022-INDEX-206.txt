BIOL/POUL 4060/6060 Spring 2022
Reproductive Endocrinology

Course Description:

The principles of reproductive endocrinology will be taught using the bird as a model species. Research findings from humans and farm animal species will also be utilized to provide the most complete and current information on the hormonal control of reproduction. Emphasis will be placed on follicular development, spermatogenesis, fertilization, endocrine disruptors, sex determination and selection, sexual differentiation, and embryology.

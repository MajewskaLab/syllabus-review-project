COURSE DESCRIPTION: 4 Credits. Population structure and dynamics, species interactions, organization
and classification of communities, and nutrient cycling and energy flow in ecosystems.

OBJECTIVES: This course is designed to give a solid, fundamental understanding of how organisms
interact with their environment and other life forms, shaping the world around us. We will examine processes at numerous scales, from individuals to communities and ecosystems. As humans are also organisms, we will also explore how ecological processes shed light on human-environment interactions. The course aims to empower students with knowledge to understand, analyze, and evaluate both scientific and societal dimensions of environmental issues.
TEXTBOOKS:
 Required course textbook: Ricklefs & Relyea. 2014. The Economy of Nature (7th edition).  Recommended resources: Gotelli, N. Primer of Ecology (any edition); a subset of primary literature
case studies will be made available on eLC
COURSE FORMAT, POLICIES, AND EXPECTATIONS:  LECTURES: 50-minutes with a number of in-class participation exercises.
 Lectures will cover content from Ricklefs chapters, plus special topics of environmental/social relevance.
 Any readings for special topics will be announced in advance and posted on eLC.  Students are responsible for all material covered in the lectures, including special topics.  We will do our best to post a handout/powerpoint for each lecture by 8am the morning of class.
NOTE: the handouts are not complete lecture notes! They will contain blanks for you to fill in.
 Ecology is about thinking through relationships and processes. The lectures make those dynamics easier to understand by walking through them. Attending lectures will greatly facilitate your success in this course - both by helping you grasp the ideas, and through participation points.
 IN-CLASS EXERCISES are quick, easy opportunities to reflect, interact, provide feedback, and earn
credit for attending and engaging on a day to day basis. These may be graded for content or simply for completion at the discretion of the faculty. Exercises that are graded for content will be

announced by the faculty at the time they are assigned. If you have to miss class for a documented reason, please let us know beforehand, and provide formal documentation.  In-class exercises are unannounced and held during lecture, and cannot be made up.
 LABS: Weekly, including outdoor field trips. LABS START 2ND WEEK OF CLASS. Your specific
Graduate Teaching Assistant will communicate with your lab section about the lab syllabus, schedule, requirements, etc.
 EXAMS: 3 in-class (multiple choice and short answer), and a concise final exam covering new
material and some cumulative material.  Students are expected to be active learners: attending class, taking notes, asking questions, and
reading the text in order to prepare for exams.  Most of the content of powerpoint presentations will be posted on the course eLC site
(eLC.uga.edu) to help you study. Key concepts are often left as blanks for you to fill in, using lecture notes and the text. Therefore, these powerpoints by themselves do not constitute a complete resource for studying for exams. They require your input!

TIPS FOR SUCCESS:
 How to use the textbook in your learning.... Content from the text book provides depth and clarity on lecture topics. Not every part of each chapter of the book will be covered in the class. The lecture materials should be your first guide for knowing what to study.
 At the end of each Ricklefs chapter are study questions. Can you answer them??  There is a companion website for the text - you can register for free and take self-exams. These
are excellent preparation for class exams!  Learning ecology is not about memorizing terms. There are terms you need to know, but it's
much more about understanding processes. We suggest finding a team of classmates to study with, and that you get into the habit of discussing concepts that are covered in lecture.  We will occasionally post journal articles that relate to particular case studies we cover in lecture - these are usually also an excellent resource for review on specific topics.

 Note: Missed exams may not be made up. If unavoidable circumstances arise, absence from exams must be arranged in advance and only for serious reasons. In special cases of documented emergencies, a makeup exam may be allowed, at the discretion of the instructors (http://bulletin.uga.edu/bulletin/ind/attendance.html).

COMMUNICATION:
We will use eLC and email to communicate class announcements. If you need to contact us about an absence, office hours, or a question, please be sure to include "ECOL 3500" in the subject line of your emails. We do our best to respond to emails within 24 hours (during the week) - please email again if you haven't heard back.
ACADEMIC HONESTY:
In this course, all students must uphold their pledge to the University's Honor Code: "I will be academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others." All academic work must meet the standards contained in A Culture of Honesty, and each student is responsible for knowing the standards and the meaning of academic honesty. Please refer to the UGA policy, located on the web at http://honesty.uga.edu/ Lack of knowledge of what constitutes dishonest work is not an acceptable excuse. If you're not sure - ASK FIRST! Students should also be aware that it is the instructors' responsibility to report cases of suspected academic dishonesty directly to the Office of the Vice President for Instruction. This can result in a grade of "F" for the course, even worse penalties from the University, and much grief all around.
SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS:
Students with disabilities or health related issues who may need class accommodation should consult with the instructor as soon as possible. Accommodations cannot be provided until a student has gone through The Disability Resource Center (DRC) (https://drc.uga.edu/students/register-for-services; (706)542-8719) and we have discussed appropriate accommodations for this course. Accommodations cannot be provided retroactively. All conversations will be strictly confidential.

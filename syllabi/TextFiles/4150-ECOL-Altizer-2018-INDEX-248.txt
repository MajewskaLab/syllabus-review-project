Spring 2018
Lecture: Tue & Thu 11:00-12:15 Lab: Mon or Wed 1:30-3:00 Place: auditorium (lecture); conference room 12 (discussions)/computer room 29 (lab)

Description: This course introduces students to the field of infectious disease ecology, an area of study that has developed rapidly over the past three decades and addresses some of the most significant challenges to human health and conservation. Students will learn about the incredible diversity of parasitic organisms, arguably the most abundant life forms on the planet, and examine how infections invade and spread through host populations. Throughout the course, an emphasis will be placed on understanding of infectious diseases dynamics at the population level. Specific topics include types of pathogens and their ecological properties, epidemiology and impacts on host populations, types of transmission, evolution of resistance and virulence, drivers of the emergence of new diseases, parasites in the context of ecological communities, strategies for controlling outbreaks, and the role of parasites in biodiversity and conservation.
Class objectives: 1. Provide an understanding of biological interactions between hosts and their
microbes/parasites 2. Increase familiarity with quantitative approaches for studying infectious disease spread 3. Review current research and case studies in the field of infectious disease ecology 4. Enhance appreciation for the taxonomic and biological diversity of parasitic organisms and
host responses to infection 5. Examine the importance of parasites in biodiversity conservation and human health 6. Consider the role of ecology and evolution in predicting pathogen emergence and responding
to epidemics
Format: The course format includes lecture, discussion of scientific papers, computer assignments and problem sets. Students are expected to attend lectures on a regular basis, complete regular assignments, and prepare for and participate in class discussions.
Prerequisites: This course assumes familiarity with general ecology and biology, and past coursework in calculus, linear algebra or statistics.
Attendance: Most students find the lecture topics to be interesting. As we have no formal text, lectures will not duplicate material found elsewhere. Since students will be responsible for this
1

information on the exams, attendance and note taking are important. Students who miss a class will be expected to submit assignments on time. More than 6 unexcused absences from lecture, and 4 unexcused absences from weekly labs/discussion sessions may result in an automatic lowering of the final score by one letter grade. (Excused absence requests should be submitted in writing prior to or immediately following an absence, with appropriate documentation).
Labs and assignments: Laboratory attendance is mandatory, and students must arrive on time. Assignments will accompany lab activities. Unless otherwise specified, homework assignments will be due by 5pm one week following the distribution of the assignment. All lab assignments will be submitted electronically via eLC. Late assignments will be penalized 10% per week day. For weeks where a discussion is indicated as the lab activity, students should come to the discussion section with a short (1/2 page SS) summary of the assigned reading.
Reading materials: Reading material for this course is based on journal articles and book chapters. Lectures will often refer to ideas and results from assigned readings, and exams will cover content from each of the readings. A full reading list is maintained at the end of the syllabus, and papers will be uploaded onto eLC (https://uga.view.usg.edu/) prior to the assigned reading date.
Lecture quizzes: Approximately 15 minutes into many of the lectures, a short quiz will be given. Quizzes will consist of questions that are designed to assess student comprehension of the previous lecture and/or the assigned reading material for the current lecture. We expect approximately 15 quizzes will be given during the term. Make-up quizzes will not be offered, but students can drop their four lowest quiz scores at the end of the semester, which can include quizzes that were missed owing to class absences.
Exams: There will be two in-class exams on February 22 and on April 19. Exams will include a variety of question types, such as T/F, Multiple choice, Short answer, and Essay.
Participation: Students will be graded based on their participation in lecture, lab, and during the end of year symposium. Participation includes asking questions, actively listening, arriving on time to lab and lecture, and participating in occasional short in-class activities (e.g. students team up to discuss a question and individual, written responses are handed in to the instructor).
Grade calculation: 30% Lab assignments 10% Lecture quizzes 25% First exam 25% Second exam 10% Participation, symposium and class discussions
Enrollment in 6150: Students enrolled in the graduate course number will complete additional problems on assignments and exams that require synthesis of class and reading materials, and will lead one discussion session during the spring semester. They will additionally deliver a 1015 min oral presentation at the time of the final class symposium on May 1.
Class symposium: On May 1st from 12:00-3:00pm (the time reserved for our final exam), we will host a class symposium in the format of a scientific conference. Attendance is mandatory for all students. Students enrolled in 6150 will give an oral research presentation on the topic of
2

their choosing, and students enrolled in 4150 can elect to give a talk or poster for bonus credit towards their final grades. Students will submit proposed titles and abstracts the week of Mar 6. These will be returned to students immediately following spring break with approval and comments from the instructors.
Accommodations: Please contact the instructor if you require special accommodations due to learning disabilities, religious practices, physical or medical needs, or any other reason.
General Notes: (i) All academic work must meet the standards contained in "A Culture of Honesty." Students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work. The link to more detailed information about academic honesty can be found at: https://ovpi.uga.edu/academic-honesty (ii) The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructors may be necessary.

Neuromuscular Exercise Physiology KINS4690/6690 Fall 2017

The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.

Description

This class consists of two components: 1) the structure and physiology of skeletal muscle function, and 2) applied skeletal muscle physiology with an emphasis on exercise, fatigue, disuse, disease, and injury.

Grading policy** To comply with new pilot grading system, 100-92 A, 91-90 A-, 89-88 B+, 87-82 B, 81-80 B-, 79-78 C+, 77-72 C, 71-70 C-, etc.

** There is no rounding of grades. For example, a 91.95% is an A-. If a student wishes to have an exam re-graded, she/he must submit in writing the nature of the problem, and the exam, no later than one week after the exam has been returned. The entire exam will be rechecked.

Honors and Graduate Credit Honors and graduate credit will require extra work. This includes two brief presentations to the class and short essay questions on the final exam.

Attendance Attendance of lectures is optional but encouraged. All of the information on the exams will come from the lectures. Attendance of all laboratory sessions and scheduled lecture exams is required. No make up exams or lab quizzes will be given unless official UGA excuse is given (i.e., medical leave, etc.). Students are required to notify course or lab instructor prior to an exam or quiz in order to obtain permission to reschedule an exam or lab session.

(3) University Honor Code and Academic Honesty Policy All academic work must meet the standards contained in "A Culture of Honesty." Each student is responsible to inform themselves about those standards before performing any academic work.
Copies of the honor code can be obtained from the Office of the Vice President for Instruction or may be viewed at the following web site: http://www.uga.edu/ovpi/honesty/acadhon.htm
(4) Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy The University of Georgia ("the University") is committed to maintaining a fair and respectful environment for living, work and study. To that end, and in accordance with federal and state law, University System of Georgia policy, and University policy, the University prohibits harassment of or discrimination against any person because of race, color, sex (including sexual harassment and pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity or national origin, religion, age, genetic information, disability, or veteran status by any member of the University Community (as defined below) on campus, in connection with a

University program or activity, or in a manner that creates a hostile environment for any member of the University Community. Incidents of harassment and discrimination will be met with appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal or expulsion from the University.

Other Important Information for MIBO/MMIB4220-6220:

Students taking MIBO6220 or MIBO4220 Honors must contact Dr. Karls to arrange for their graduate or Honors project. There is a separate syllabus for Grad/Honors that describes how grades will be calculated based on exams, quizzes, and the project.

Reading assignments, including journal articles and chapters/pages in the text book, will be posted on the WebCT page for each lecturer. The required Text book is "Cellular Microbiology", 2nd Edition, Edts. Cossart, Boquet, Normark, and Rappuoli. An excellent online textbook, which has chapters on many of the pathogens covered in the course, is found at: http://www.textbookofbacteriology.net/ (Please donate $10 to use this textbook). A supplemental text book on Immunology is available in the bookstore: "Basic Immunology", Third Edition, Abbas & Lichtman. The text book supports the lectures on Immunology very well. It is highly recommended that you read the assigned material BEFORE class; it will help you to follow the lectures and take more complete notes in class. Reading the assigned journal articles before class discussion is required.

There will be 5 quizzes on the assigned journal articles; these quizzes will be 20% of your grade. There are no make-up quizzes, so if you miss a quiz, that is counted as a zero. However, you can drop your lowest quiz grade, thus the remaining quiz scores will count for the 20% of your grade. There will be 4 exams; the fourth exam will be during the final exam period. Each exam is 20% of your grade, so all 4 exams are 80% of your grade. If you miss an exam (unexcused), that is scored as a zero. Make-up exams for excused absences must be arranged with Dr. Karls well in advance for University-approved absences or the day of return from an illness (Doctor's excuse is required for full period of absence). Exams may have a mix of short answer, discussion, multiple choice, and fill-in tables. You must use a pen to take the exams or you cannot request a re-grade. Re-grading must be requested in writing with an explanation of the reason that re-grading is needed. You have 7 days after the exam is returned to the class to request a re-grade (turn in your request to the TA). Grade Scale: A 100-93, A- 92-90, B+ 89-87, B 86-83, B- 82-80, C+ 79-77, C 76-73, C- 72-70, D+ 69-67, D 66-63, D- 62-60, F <60. Note: grades ending in >.5 round up to the next whole number, e.g. 92.6 rounds to 93, but 92.5 counts as 92.

There are no designated office hours for the Instructors; you may set up appointments with the Faculty or TA by e-mail (Please do not just drop by our offices!): Dr. Karls (Course Director) akarls@uga.edu Dr. Lee mdlee@uga.edu Dr. Maier rmaier@uga.edu Dr. Maurer jmaurer@uga.edu TA:

Course name: MIBO/IDIS 4220/6220 Slides for each lecture will be posted to the e-Learning Commons (eLC). There are links to other resources on eLC, as well. However, much of the material for the course is NOT available on eLC. In addition, there is significant material covered in lectures that is NOT in the textbook. Therefore it is essential that you attend lectures and take notes to fully understand the material for this course.

All academic work must meet the standards contained in "A Culture of Honesty." Students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work. http://www.uga.edu/ovpi/academic_honesty/academic_honesty.htm
The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.

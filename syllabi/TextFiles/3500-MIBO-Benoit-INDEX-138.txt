Textbook: Microbiology (1st edition) by Wessner, Dupont & Charles (John Wiley & Sons Publishing, 2013). You can choose to purchase it as an e-book/WileyPLUS (ISBN#:9781118566855) or if you prefer a physical text, a binder version which also comes with ebook/WileyPLUS access (ISBN#: 9781118566848). We will be using the WileyPLUS online component for weekly assignments; go to www.wileyplus.com to register your account.

Course Format: There is no Honors Option for this class. Students enrolled in MIBO7500 should make an appointment with the instructor to discuss additional requirements.
· During week one (drop/add week), we will meet at the assigned class meeting times on Tuesday and Thursday to provide an introduction to the course. Students will be sorted into collaborative learning groups for group work (begins during week two). Groups will be determined during the first week of class meetings. Group seating assignments will be posted as PDFs on our eLC course site. Groups will remain the same all semester.
· Beginning week two, students will sit in their assigned groups during class time to participate in group learning activities with the instructor and course assistants. Students are expected to review the assigned readings and animations PRIOR to attending class on Tuesday and Thursday.

Course Communication: You are expected to check the eLC News Widget for course announcements regularly. You can set up your eLC account to send course news notifications by email or text, if you prefer. (There's a drop-down menu beneath your name: profile, notifications, and account settings preferences are set there.)
· For personal issues/concerns, students should send emails to the course email box: mib3500uga@gmail.com. The mailbox is checked by instructors and the course assistants Monday-Friday. Using this common email address allows the instructors and the course assistants to respond effectively to all questions/concerns. WARNING!: Sending an email directly to an instructor's personal account will not get you any faster response.
· Course material questions should be posted to the e-SNS Discussions Board (see e-SNS Discussions below) using the link in eLC menu. In the eSNS Discussions, you can choose to make your post showing your name, or click the box to post it as"Anonymous". Posting questions and responses here benefits everyone in the class.
Attendance: Students are expected to attend all assigned class meetings and are responsible for all content and instructions given during class time as well as news/announcements made on eLC. There are NO MAKE-UP opportunities for missed weekly quizzes, exams and activities. INSTEAD, you may drop one exam and miss up to 25% of in-class quiz questions and still earn full points.
Course Slides, Reading Schedule & Learning Objectives: Powerpoints used for class and a reading list are available via eLC. Many students find that printing the slides and adding additional notes to them while listening to the lecture is beneficial. To assist you in studying and preparing for the exams, you will also find the expected learning objectives listed for each chapter or chapter groupings.
Course Withdrawal Policy: Any student who chooses to withdraw prior to the midpoint withdrawal deadline (Thursday October 23rd) will be recorded with a WP. Any student wishing to pursue a withdrawal after this deadline must do so through UGA's Student Support Services Office (http://studentsupport.uga.edu/services/hardship_withdrawal.htm). No student withdrawal will be initiated by the instructor for any reason. Academic Honesty Statement: As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty," and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: www.uga.edu/honesty. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor. The link to more detailed information about academic honesty can be found at: http://www.uga.edu/ovpi/honesty/acadhon.htm

Point Breakdown: 430 points are available for the semester, excluding extra credit opportunities - see individual discussions

on each graded item. We will use eLC's gradebook for official grade calculations; TopHat and WileyPLUS have their own

independent gradebooks which will be imported into eLC New weekly. Your final course percentage and letter grade will be

calculated by this formula:

(Total points + XC points) x 100 = % Course grade

430 total pts possible

Best 3 exams @ 100 pts each= 4 SNS-posts @ 5 pts each = 10 Wiley Plus assignments @ 5 pts each= 6 Quizzes following in class small group activities @ 10 pts each=

300 pts 20 pts 50 pts 60 pts

TOTAL

430 pts

Letter (Course) Grades: Due to amount of participation points and extra credit offered, there is NO CURVE in this class. Letter grade assignments will be made according to your course percentage on the following scale:

A = (4.0) = 92.45-100% A- = (3.7) = 89.45 - 92.44% B+ = (3.3) = 86.45- 89.44% B = (3.0) = 82.45 - 86.44% B- = (2.7) = 79.45 - 82.44%

C+ = (2.3) = 76.45 - 79.44% C = (2.0) = 72.45- 76.44% C- = (1.7) = 69.45 - 72.44% D = (1.0) = 59.45 - 69.44% F = (0.0) = 59.44% or below

Exams: Tests will focus on material covered in lectures, in-class activities, and the assigned readings. There will be four tests given, but only your highest three scores will be used in your final grade calculation

· Exams will be a mixture of multiple choice questions and short answer questions, totaling 100 pts possible per exam.

· There are NO makeup exams - a missed exam will be recorded as a 0 and used as your drop exam.

· If you have questions regarding your exam grade, please make an appointment with your instructor within one week of posting of grades. All questions about exam grading must be submitted as a clearly written or typed hardcopy within one week of your appointment - late requests can be discussed, but no points back will be returned.

In-Class Activities with Quiz: Activities may be done on either lecture day and will vary from week to week. Groups will be formed by instructors and posted on eLC by Monday August 25th at noon. A room map with group seat assignments will also be posted. Make sure you know your group number and seat assignment before class on August 26th.

· Students are expected to come prepared to class to work as a group to answer the questions posed during class. Prepared means: 1) completing the reading assignment/animations and 2) reading any background scenario posted on eLC new for the scheduled activity.
· During the activity, you may use online resources, your notes, or textbook to help your group answer the questions.
· Use of personal technology (texting friends, using facebook/apps, etc.) is severely frowned upon. WARNING!: If you indulge in such activities while your group is still working on the learning activity, 5 points for the activity quiz will be deducted from your personal grade.

· Post-activity quizzes will be taken INDIVIDUALLY at the end of the activity and will assess the content covered in the in-class activities. Each quiz will consist of questions worth a total of 10 points. You must be physically present to take the quiz. Six (6) post-activity quizzes will be given over the semester. Questions and answers will be administered through Top Hat. See the following section for Top Hat instructions.

· To counter the effects of absences and technical issues with Top Hat, the following rubric will be used to calculate your FINAL quiz point total at the end of the term:

Total % Correct Answers Received (For Post-Activity Quiz) 75.0 % 65.0 - 74.9% 55.0 - 64.9% 45.0 - 54.9% 35.0 - 44.9% 25.0 - 34.9% 10.0 - 24.9% 5.0 - 9.9% <5.0 %

Final Quiz Points Recorded (60 pts max) 60 pts 50 pts 40 pts 30 pts 20 pts 10 pts 5 pts 2 pts 0 pts

Your first WileyPLUS assignment will be due on Monday August 25th.
e-SNS Class Discussions: You can contribute to the wall with your name visible to others, or as "Anonymous". If you check the "Keep my name anonymous" option in your posting, this means that your post will not have your name or personal information associated with it publicly. However, for grade-tracking purposes, your posts will be confidentially associated with your name for the instructors' review.
· COURSE CONTENT QUESTIONS & ANSWERS WALL INSTRUCTIONS:
You are required to make at least one post on this wall before each exam period! The class roster is divided alphabetically in due dates for posts. For example Kim Davies has a deadline post of Sept. 1st while Nikaia Zane has a deadline of Sept. 8th before Exam 1. See course schedule. You may post at any time but you must post at least once before your allotted deadline to receive possible credit. Your posts should be a genuine content question or a response that helps to answer a peer's question. "Likes" and other posts that do not add to learning will not earn you points. There is no partial credit.
1) If You Have a Course Content Question: Simply post your course content question in this forum and check back for responses from your classmates and the instruction staff. This is not the forum for course procedural questions- check your syllabus for the answer or post it in the "Free Discussion" wall.
2) If You Have a Course Content Answer: Post a reply to your peer's course content question in the forum and add to everyone's learning. The instruction staff will also post feedback on your comments.
3) To earn the 5 points, your post must be original in content. In other words, you cannot rephrase a question or comment already posted nor can you cut and paste text from an outside source. Keep in mind if you submit just before the deadline you will not be able to receive immediate feedback.

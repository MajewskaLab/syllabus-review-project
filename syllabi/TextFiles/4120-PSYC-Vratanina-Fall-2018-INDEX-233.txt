If you would like to meet with me, I strongly encourage you to send me an email to set up a time that will work best for both our schedules. Also, a note about email communication; you can expect a reply within 24 hours of sending your email, however, this does not mean you necessarily will receive an immediate reply or a reply the same day that you sent your message so please take note when attempting to set up an appointment. Additionally, I may or may not respond to emails after business hours (outside of 9 am - 5 pm or on the weekends) so please don't wait until the last minute to contact me with questions.

Course Description How organisms sense and perceive the environment. Topics discussed are anatomy and physiology of the sensory systems, types of stimuli affecting sensory systems, and current knowledge and theories of our perceptual abilities. Prerequisite or Corequisite: PSYC 2990 or PSYC 3990

Course Objectives Upon completion of this course, you should be able to:
 understand the basic neurophysiology that underlies sensory coding across all sense modalities.  know the basic anatomy and physiology of each sense modality.  understand the role the brain plays in interpreting sensory information to give rise to perception.  appreciate the importance of both physiological and behavioral studies to our understanding of
human sensation and perception.  explain the area of psychophysics and how it relates the physical world to perception.

1. Virtual Labs: Throughout the semester I will give you virtual laboratory activities to complete on your own outside of class. These assignments will serve to reinforce the concepts we are covering in class and give you extra practice understanding it. More information will be given as the semester progresses.
2. Exams: There will be a total of 4 exams throughout the semester but only 3 will count toward your final grade. I will drop your lowest exam score. Each of the exams will consist of multiplechoice and/or short-answer questions from your textbook, additional readings, and class notes.
3. Student Demonstrations: As an additional way to encourage you to be more active in the course, you will conduct an in-class demonstration that illustrates a specific perceptual process. This also will give you the opportunity to creatively apply the course material. Your demonstration should be take no more than 15 minutes and should help your classmates better understand the material. You will receive a handout specifically outlining expectations and additional information for this assignment.
4. Current Empirical Articles: Each week you will be required to find an empirical article that addresses one of the topics/concepts covered in class that week. This will help to familiarize you with the empirical work that is done to further our understanding of the various topics we cover in class. You may only pick empirical articles; they must come from reputable psychology or related journals (e.g., Science, Nature, Vision Research, etc). For each article, you must bring in a copy of the abstract and concise and complete answers to the following questions: a. What is the main point of the article? b. What is the major research question and what are some of the hypotheses? c. How do the methodologies used in the study target the sensory or perceptual process(s) being evaluated? d. How do the findings relate to information covered in the text or in class?

If you have a disability and require reasonable classroom accommodations, please see me after class or make an appointment.

**Grades will not be rounded up and there will be no extra credit opportunities for individual students. Do not wait until the end of the semester to get help if your grade is not where you want it to be or you are struggling with the course material. Please come see me immediately so that we can deal with any issues before it is too late to improve.**

Course Policies  Attendance and preparation for class are expected. You are responsible for all class content and announcements whether you are present or not. It is important that you complete reading assignments before coming to class. There is not time in lecture to cover everything discussed in the readings; lectures will be used to highlight important topics and go into more depth on difficult concepts, as well as having discussions, watching video clips, etc. Lectures may also cover material not covered directly in the readings. **CHECK ELC REGULARLY FOR ANNOUNCEMENTS & OTHER COURSE MATERIAL**  Decisions about Grades: You have one week from receiving a grade on an exam or assignment to challenge that grade (unless there is a mathematical/clerical error which you can document). After one week, I will not discuss grade changes on past assignments. If you would like to meet with me about a graded assignment/project, you must write a brief summary which includes the following: one paragraph summarizing the assignment instructions and a second paragraph explaining why your assignment met the criteria. This written summary must be submitted to me 24 hours prior to our scheduled appointment to discuss your grade. Additionally, if you ask me to review your assignment, you should be prepared for the possibility that your grade may decrease if I find additional errors/issues that I missed the first time around.  Missed Exams: Exams cannot be made up under any circumstances. One examination from the four will be dropped at the end of the semester, so it is advisable not to "plan" a drop examination. Save the drop examination in case of emergency. If no examinations need to be dropped by the final examination session, the final can be exempted.  Late Arrivals on Exam Days: While I understand particular circumstances might make you late on an exam day, my policy for late students is that I WILL NOT let you take the exam if someone in the class has already completed and left the exam.  Late Assignments: All assignments are due at the beginning of class unless otherwise stated. Assignments turned in after 11:15 am will be considered one day late. For every 24 hours after the time the assignment is due, 1 letter grade will be deducted from the final grade. I will not accept late assignments after 3 days (including weekends); you will earn a 0. No exceptions.  Incomplete Grades: A grade of incomplete is only assigned in extremely unusual circumstances. Such situations require extensive documentation and approval of faculty supervisors. It is only an option if a student is passing the class and is typically only awarded when a student has completed the majority of the class work and is only missing one or two exams or assignments. If a grade of incomplete is approved, a written plan for completion of the coursework must be developed by the instructor and student.  Academic Honesty: As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty," and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: www.uga.edu/honesty. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.

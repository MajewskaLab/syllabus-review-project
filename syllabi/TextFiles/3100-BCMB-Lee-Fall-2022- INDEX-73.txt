Good news: this class is supported by Division of Academic Enhancement. PLAs are students who successfully took this course in a previous semester and are returning this semester to support you and your learning. They have received special training on how people learn and how to be an effective resource for you. In addition, they will meet regularly with your instructor to understand how to best support your learning in this course. PLAs are not here to reteach the material, nor to provide you with the answers, nor to evaluate your work. They do not grade assignments or exams and are not teaching assistants (TAs). PLAs are here specifically to help you learn by enhancing discussions and activities in this class. They will help you get the most out of classroom activities by clarifying instructions and assisting you in finding the right questions to deepen your learning. So, get to know your PLAs and take advantage of their training on your journey to academic success.

Communication and Technology

To comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), all communication that refers to individual students must be conducted either in person or through a secure medium (i.e., UGAMail or eLC). Instructors are not allowed to respond to messages that refer to individual students or student progress in the course through non-UGA accounts, phone calls, or other forms of electronic media.

The use of computers is strongly encouraged because it will be necessary at times for responding to questions via Top Hat and for accessing information on the web. HOWEVER, using technology for purposes unrelated to class is prohibited. Not only would you be cheating yourself out of an opportunity to learn, but you would also be hurting your group. Please be respectful of class time.
Course Description
In this course, we will explore the chemistry of life.
This course has been designed to facilitate your learning of the topics of biochemistry and molecular biology. During our semester together, we will work on case studies, which have been chosen not only for the material they will teach you but also to give you a chance to develop problem-solving skills and scientific reasoning. You will learn about biochemical concepts and principles such as the chemical properties of the cellular environment, the thermodynamics and kinetics of biochemical reactions, metabolic pathways and how they are regulated, and the structure and function of biomolecules. You will not be expected to memorize the twenty amino acids that make up the proteins in our bodies, nor will you be asked to write the citric acid cycle from memory. Rather, you should be able to use information about amino acids and metabolism to answer broader questions about biochemistry. I expect you to come to class prepared to work, having read the relevant materials before class. I expect you to work during class, which means you will need to bring your textbook, your case, and a device with which you can access the Internet.

Course Organization

This course is divided into four units, each of which ends in an exam. Each unit will be detailed in a unit calendar, which will be posted on eLC at the beginning of the unit. The unit calendars will list learning objectives, readings, quizzes, case studies, and in-class activities on a day-by-day basis. You are responsible for downloading the unit calendars and completing all readings, quizzes, case studies, and exams as specified in the calendars.

Unit
1 Water and Proteins 2 Carbohydrate Metabolism 3 Integrated Metabolism 4 Amino Acid metabolism and
Nucleic Acids Final Exam (optional)

Course Sessions
Aug 17 - Sep 19 Sep 23 - Oct 12 Oct 14 - Nov 7 Nov 11 - Dec 2

Exams Sep 21 Oct 14 (Breakout session) Nov 9 Dec 5
Dec 9 (3:30 PM - 4:30 PM)

All course sessions will be used to help you meet the learning objectives and achieve success on the assessments. Therefore, attendance is required at all sessions including breakout session. During any one session, we may be (1) discussing cases, (2) solving problems, (3) reviewing for exams, or (4) discussing exams. You will have time to work with the material both alone and in groups, ask and respond to questions, and write and reflect. When necessary, I will give lectures on difficult concepts, but you will also be expected to work during each session.

Flow of One Topic Within a Unit

Each unit is made up of multiple topics. The time spent on each topic varies with the complexity of the topic.

Assessment

I expect you to take charge of your learning in this class. There is not enough time for us to cover every detail of biochemistry during class; therefore, you will have to do some learning on your own. You should expect to attend all class sessions and participate. Learning is not a spectator sport!

The best way to be successful is to complete ALL readings and assignments.

Reading quizzes (48 points, 7.6%) There will be one quiz per topic that covers the reading assignments. The quizzes must be completed BEFORE class on eLC. Two lowest grades will be dropped.

Case studies (99 points, 15.7%) There will be approximately one case study per week. These assignments will require you to apply knowledge you have gained from the reading and class discussion to real-life scenarios. Two lowest grades will be dropped.

Top Hat Questions (40 points, 6.3%) There will be two or three Top Hat questions in a class. These questions will draw upon your understanding of Case Studies previously submitted. You should attend in-person class or zoom class to take the quiz.

Participation on Top Hat (40 points, 6.3%) This will be assessed using Top Hat question. You will receive the points by just answering the Top Hat questions.

Course evaluation (3 points, 0.5%) Complete the end-of-course evaluation and receive these points.

Unit Exams (400 points, 63.5 %) These will include multiple-choice and short essay questions. There will be four unit exams. These exams will give you the opportunity to apply your understanding of biochemistry to novel problems. Unit exams will focus upon the

4

material within each unit. Technically, they are not cumulative, though they may draw upon your understanding of concepts from previous units.
*Final Exam (100 points) - Optional It will replace the lowest grade among the four unit exams. If you were to do worst on the final than your other exams, the final will be dropped. Draws on material from Unit 1, Unit 2, Unit 3, and 4.
Unit exams and final will be administered on eLC using Respondus Lockdown Browser (LDB) in class room as scheduled. You need to bring a laptop or iPad.
Grading Policies
· Late Reading Quizzes will NOT be accepted. · Case studies will be accepted for 4 days after the due date but 1 point will
be deducted for every day you are late. · You should turn in your cases to the eLC assignment drop box. Only
Word files (.doc or docx) are allowed for submission. · 6 questions of each case studies will be selected randomly and graded
using a grading rubric, worth 1.5 points each: 1.5 point: question correct 1.0 points: question partially correct 0.75 point: question incorrect but attempted 0 points: question not answered
· There is NO MAKE-UP for any missed Top Hat Question, Reading quiz, case, or exam.
· If you must miss an exam for a university-sanctioned event (e.g., an athletic competition) or a graduate/professional school interview, you may arrange an early exam. You must provide written documentation of the event to the professor at least one week prior to the date when you would like to take the exam.
· Appeals for Top Hat participations and Top Hat Questions must be verbally made to me just after class (that is, the day of).
· Grade appeals (except Top Hat grade) must be submitted to me in writing within two weeks of receiving the grade.
· To be excused from class, students must submit the document proving the situation.
In order to be fair, there are no exceptions to these policies.

I will determine the actual grade cutoffs based on the distribution of course percentages (see above). I anticipate that the class average of final grade will be in mid 80s. Depending on the class distribution, the lower limit of each grade shown above may be lowered. Examples: you will receive an A if you get at least 93%, but depending on the class average, the lowest A might be 92.5%; you will receive a B if you get at least 83%, but depending on the class average, the lowest B might be 82%; you will receive a C if you get at least 70%, but depending on class average, the lowest C might be 68%. If the class average is above 83%, the cutoffs for each grade will NOT be raised.

Guidelines for Recommendation Letters
I will write recommendation letters for students that achieve an A or A- in my class. If you do not achieve those grades, I will write you a letter if you have clearly demonstrated hard work as demonstrated by multiple appearances to office hours for help and at least 90% attendance.

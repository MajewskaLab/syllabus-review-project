Enrollment: Participation in this course requires enrollment in the corequisite lab (BIOL 1107L), unless the lab has been completed. Although lecture and lab are linked in Athena, these two courses are independent. For enrollment questions, contact the biology advising office at (706) 583-0496.

Course Materials: There is no textbook for this course, but instructional materials will be posted on eLC during the semester. If you are unable to access the website, contact the help desk at (706) 542-3106. We will use the Top Hat response system during class, and you will need a device that connects to the Internet for participation. Licenses are $22 per semester for UGA students, and you should receive an invitation with the join code for Top Hat by email during the first week of class.

We will not have class on March 4 and instead you will be expected to participate in the UGA Health Professions Fair 2021 Wednesday, March 3, 2021, 11:00AM-3:00PM (Eastern Time)

The goal of the Health Professions Fair is to provide UGA pre-professional students the opportunity to connect directly with recruiters and admissions representatives from health professional schools across the country. We hope that through these connections, our students can learn more about the programs and their options when applying to graduate professional schools. This Fair will include representatives from medical, dental, veterinary, optometry, allied health, physician assistant, and pharmacy programs.

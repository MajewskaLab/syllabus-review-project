Class Attendance and Participation Policy
Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we can only allow 1/3 of students to attend each session. We have decided that students with last names A-G may attend Mondays, H-O may attend Wednesdays, and P-Z may attend Fridays. You can always attend virtually via Top Hat, and even those in class will need to login to Top Hat during class to be able to participate through synchronous polling questions that will be worth 10% of your final grade. If you respond to 80% of all the in-class questions posed during the semester (no penalty for incorrect answers), you will receive all the attendance points.

Group Assignments
Each module includes homework assignments, some completed solo and others with a group. I will assign you to one of 70 groups on Top Hat. You will be able to text with your group using the Top Hat app even if some of you are not in class to help answer questions and work through problems. You will also be able to take group tests together during the class period directly before our end-of-unit tests.

The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.

Assessment Format
Tests will be multiple-choice, matching, and ordering with a focus on application and analysis. There will be a total of 5 tests, but only 4 scores will be counted in your final grade. If you have to miss a test or choose to miss a test, you will not be penalized. Consequently, there are no make-up tests. There will be practice tests posted on Top Hat for you to test your understanding that is available during the last class session before the test. For each of the practice tests given during the regular semester, you will be allowed to take the test with your group. If you did not understand a question, this is your opportunity to have it clarified and corrected for you by someone in your group. This instant feedback will not only improve your grade, but it will help you learn the material better for your own test performance.

how to benefit from teamwork
You will be working with a group of 4 people all semester during class assignments and group tests. Why? Because the act of exchanging reasoning and explaining your own understanding helps you learn better and makes the class more fun.
To work effectively, however, every member of your group needs to contribute. If a member misses a test or fails to contribute on an assignment, that person cannot be awarded points but will have to make up the work individually. You will get the opportunity to (anonymously) let us know that you are having a problem with your group through an online survey after the first two units.

bickering
Ineffective groups don't see eye to eye: one member dominates while another member coasts on other's work. It is critical that every member of the group comes prepared and works equally. If members fail to attend meetings, don't complete their portion of the group task, or submit unacceptable work you have the right to "fire" that member.
Firing involves a two step process: (1) Email warning, negotiation (2) Removal from the group if not rectified. The member now has to complete all assignments individually unless adopted by a new group.
Let problematic group members know their faults on acknowledgements sections.

cooperating
In these groups, everyone works together. They listen to eachother and don't override everyone else to get their way. However, interactions are done to be efficient, with each member separately completing their share of the work.
These groups assign members different tasks but rarely give constructive feedback. Instead they just merge and submit the final assignment without trying to improve it first. It feels to these group members that the others just don't really care.

collaborating
These group members actively engage in discussion, negotiation, and consensus building. During group work in class they discuss the different answers and the reasoning for their answer, and they work to make sure that everyone in the group contributes.
One example might be a group that studies for a test by assigning each member a different section of material for that test, learning that material really, really well, and taking turns teaching their section to the rest of the group during a study session.

THE FINE PRINT

Academic Honesty
As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty," and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: https://ovpi.uga.edu/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-policy. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.

Commitment to Intersectionality
We would like to acknowledge that we are all individuals with multiple sociocultural identities that intersect and shape our worldview through the lens of privilege and oppression. Our commitment to you as your instructors is to minimize systemic forces of oppression within the classroom such as ableism, classism, racism, sexism, trans oppression, and heterosexism in efforts to create a safe(r) learning environment for all of us. We ask that you also join us in this commitment to foster respect for one another, enhance solidarity, and build community.
Online Classroom Etiquette
For optimal course performance, please refrain from instant messaging, emailing, surfing the Internet, playing games, doing homework, etc. during class time. We will be using Top Hat for presentations and assigned in-class activities that require laptop use. Make it your goal to get the most out of this shared time.

ACCOMMODATIONS
We are committed to making sure our course and materials are affirming of students living with disabilities. If you plan to request accommodations for a disability, please register with the Disability Resource Center. They can be reached by visiting Clark Howell Hall, calling 706-542-8719 (voice) or 706-542-8778 (TTY), or by visiting http://drc.uga.edu. We am here to support you, so please don't hesitate to reach out, and we can help you with any specific challenges you are experiencing with our course.

Coronavirus Information for Students
Face Coverings: As a reminder, the University of Georgia--along with all University System of Georgia (USG) institutions-- requires all faculty, staff, students, and visitors to wear an appropriate face covering while inside campus facilities/buildings where six feet social distancing may not always be possible. Anyone not using a face covering when required will be asked to wear one or must leave the area. Reasonable accommodations may be made for those who are unable to wear a face covering for documented health reasons. Students seeking an accommodation related to face coverings should contact Disability Services at https://drc.uga.edu/.
DawgCheck: Please perform a quick symptom check each weekday on DawgCheck--on the UGA app or website--whether you feel sick or not. It will help health providers monitor the health situation on campus: https://dawgcheck.uga.edu/
What do I do if I have symptoms?
Students showing symptoms should self-isolate and schedule an appointment with the University Health Center by calling 706-542-1162 (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.). Please DO NOT walk-in. For emergencies and after-hours care, see https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies.
What do I do if I test positive?
Any student with a positive COVID-19 test is required to report the test in DawgCheck and should self-isolate immediately. Students should not attend classes in-person until the isolation period is completed. Once you report the positive test through DawgCheck, UGA Student Care and Outreach will follow up with you.
What do I do if I am notified that I have been exposed?
Effective Jan. 4, 2021, students who learn they have been directly exposed to COVID-19 but are not showing symptoms should self-quarantine for 10 days (consistent with updated Department of Public Health (DPH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines). Those quarantining for 10 days must have been symptom-free throughout the monitoring period. Please correspond with your instructor via email, with a cc: to Student Care & Outreach at sco@uga.edu, to coordinate continuing your coursework while self-quarantined.
We strongly encourage students to voluntarily take a COVID-19 test within 48 hours of the end of the 10-day quarantine period (test to be administered between days 8 and 10). Students may obtain these tests at Legion Field (https://clia.vetview.vet.uga.edu/) or at the University Health Center by calling 706-542-1162 (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.). Please DO NOT walk-in the University Health Center without an appointment. For emergencies and after-hours care, see https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies
If the test is negative, the individual may return to campus, but MUST continue to closely monitor for any new COVID-19 symptoms through 14 days. DawgCheck is the best method for monitoring these symptoms. If new symptoms occur, the individual must not come to campus and must seek further testing/evaluation.
If the test is positive at the end of the 10-day period, the individual must begin a 10-day isolation period from the date of the test.
How do I participate in surveillance testing if I have NO symptoms?
We strongly encourage you to take advantage of the expanded surveillance testing that is being offered from January 4 - 22: up to 1,500 free tests per day at Legion Field and pop-up locations. Testing at Legion Field can be scheduled at https://clia.vetview.vet.uga.edu/. Walk-up appointments can usually be accommodated at Legion Field, and pop-up saliva testing does not require pre-registration. For planning purposes, precise sites and schedules for the pop-up clinics are published on the UHC's website and its social media as they are secured: https://www.uhs.uga.edu/healthtopics/covid-surveillance-testing.

Course Objectives

The objectives of the course are: (i) introduce students to modern genetic and molecular tools used to analyze microorganisms; (ii) train students in the proper method for recording scientific data; (iii) help students develop skills in the critical analysis of data and research literature; and (iv) acquaint students with aspects of experimental design.

Grading Policy
Grades will be assigned based on a standard grading scale (94-100, A; 90-93, A-; 87-89, B+; 84-86, B; 80-83, B-; etc.). Each exam is worth 15% of the final grade. The final exam is comprehensive. The lab exercises are worth 55% of the final grade. Modules 1, 3, and 7 are each worth 6%; Module 4 is worth 8%; Module 6 is worth 10%. Module 2 is worth 19% and is determined from the purification and characterization of environmental isolate (6%), phylogenetic analysis of isolates (Module 5; 3%) and final presentation (10%). Lab exercises will be graded based on the quality of the lab work (e.g, are results accurate, were experiments done thoroughly and are the results of the experiments precise and accurate), quality of lab notebook, as well as the completion of worksheets or lab write-ups for each exercise.

Class attendance is mandatory. Each unexcused absence will result in the loss of 10 percentage points subtracted from your final grade.
All academic work must meet the standards contained in "A Culture of Honesty." Students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work. More detailed information about academic honesty can be found at: www.uga.edu/ovpi/honesty/acadhon.htm
The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.
Principal Course Assignments:
Assignments will include lab exercises detailed in class handouts; maintenance of lab notebook; worksheets pertaining to the lab exercises and sample problems; primary research literature and reviews; collecting environmental samples for isolation of specific groups of bacteria; proposal describing experiments to be done with isolated bacterial species; and oral presentation on bacterium isolated. There is no text for the course. Specific course requirements for grading purposes are described in the Grading Policy.
Make-up Examinations:
Make-up exams will be allowed only for excused absences from the regularly scheduled exams and will be arranged for as close to the original exam time as possible and convenient.

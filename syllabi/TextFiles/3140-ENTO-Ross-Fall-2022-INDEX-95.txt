Laboratory and Field Exercises: In the first half of the semester, these will often involve going out in the field to study insects in their natural habitats, weather permitting. These trips also represent great opportunities to collect specimens for your arthropod collection. Be prepared to transport yourself to a pre-designated field site each laboratory session in the first half of the semester!! Wear rugged outdoor clothing, a hat, and shoes or boots that can get wet; bring sunscreen and water.

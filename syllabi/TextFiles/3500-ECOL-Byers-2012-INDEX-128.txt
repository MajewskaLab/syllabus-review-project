(Also, handouts and occasional readings on reserve in the Biological Sciences Library).

Prerequisites: [BIOL 1104 or BIOL 1108-1108L or (PBIO 1220 and PBIO 1220L)] and [(CHEM 1211 and CHEM 1211L) or (CHEM 1311H and CHEM 1311L)]. MATH 2250 highly recommended.

Your evaluation will be based on: Four exams (200 points each) Homework assignments (100 points): Laboratory reports, field/lab notebook, participation:

600* points 100 points 300 points

*Your lowest exam score among the four will be dropped. If you miss an exam you will be graded on the three you do take. There are no make-up exams.

Course total: 1000 points
Your attendance, alertness, participation, and enthusiasm are expected. Punctuality is a MUST, especially for lab!

Late Policy: If you find that you have severe conflicts with turning an assignment in on time, contact Dr. Covich or Dr. Byers (for lecture assignments) or your TA (for lab assignments) to discuss the situation before the assignment is due. Otherwise, assignments must be turned in on time.
Academic Integrity UGa students are bound by an academic honor code that details rights and responsibilities for students. You should be aware that this code provides serious sanctions for academic dishonesty (including, but not limited to, plagiarism and cheating). We expect that you will follow the honor code. If you have any questions about the honor code or about what constitutes plagiarism or cheating, please either check your UGa Student Handbook, also available on-line at http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahs/ahs.htm, or speak with Dr. Covich or Dr. Byers.
Accommodations for Students with Disabilities If you have an identified disability and will need accommodations, you should first contact The Disability Resource Center (DRC) (http://drc.uga.edu/about/registerforservices.php; 542-8719). They will discuss the UGa process and work with you to access supportive services. If you have a learning disability, the University will require you to provide supportive documentation and will develop an approved accommodation sheet for you. Accommodations cannot be provided until the accommodation sheet is established and we have met to discuss its applicability to this course. Accommodations cannot be provided retroactively. All conversations will be strictly confidential.

COVID-19 MODIFICATIONS: Face coverings in class are strongly recommended for all individuals, whether vaccinated or not. The current plan is to return to in-person class meetings this Fall, but in the event that one of our students has to go to quarantine or miss class due to illness, we will offer synchronous remote learning through Zoom (https://uga.zoom.us/) so that the student can keep up with lectures. Our goal is to keep everyone healthy, and to encourage those who suspect that they have been exposed or have contracted COVID to quarantine without fear of falling behind in the material.

Class Time, Rooms and Online Options: Lecture Tu/Th (3:55-5:10 PM) and Breakouts on Mondays (5:40 - 6:55 pm) in Room C127 of the Davison Life Sciences Bldg. The breakout is used for quizzes (see grading below).

Office Hours: Students are strongly encouraged to participate in classroom and Virtual Study Group discussions (see below). If you have a specific reason or need to meet with us one on one, please email us and we will schedule a time.

Virtual Study Groups and Study Questions: BCMB 4010 is an information-rich course that challenges students. To improve student performance, we use virtual study groups. The goal is to engage students outside of class using a free, online platform to encourage group study habits without the logistic difficulties associated with actual study groups. Briefly, each lecture includes 10-15 discussion questions that are posted on a `Google Doc' that is open to the class. The entire class works on the questions simultaneously, and can post follow-up questions to the class as a whole in order to clear up misunderstandings or to delve deeper into a specific concept. We monitor the discussions daily and point the students in the correct direction by giving hints or asking leading questions. Our participation gives the students the opportunity to interact with us outside of class. This simple platform has redefined office hours. Many students have the same questions, so instead of spending time repeatedly answering the same question with individual students, we interact with the virtual study group and address the questions for the entire class. This strategy enhances the learning experience for the entire class, including those who cannot attended office hours.

General: BCMB 4010/6010 (Biochemistry and Molecular Biology I) is the first semester of a twosemester sequence tailored to the needs of the major (the second semester is BCMB 4020/6020, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology II). The same textbook is used for both BCMB 4010/6010 and BCMB 4020/6020, and the sequence is intended to be a coherent, integrated year.
The prerequisite for BCMB 4010/6010 is CHEM 2211/L (Modern Organic Chemistry I) or the equivalent. Our philosophy of biochemistry can be summarized typographically as bioCHEMISTRY, so this prerequisite should be taken seriously.
Textbook: The book for the course is Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, 7th edition. The book may be purchased at the bookstore or at the link below (an ebook that you own, not rent): (https://store.macmillanlearning.com/us/product/Lehninger-Principles-ofBiochemistry/p/1464126119?searchText=Lehnin ) Alternatively, you may choose a less expensive older edition (Lehninger (4th - 6th editions), but be aware that you are responsible for using the table of contents and index to find the appropriate lecture material. We test from our lecture material, and the book is the primary resource for the class. The second section (BCMB 4020/6020) uses the same text book, and will accept the same, less expensive alternates.

eLC: The eLC site for BCMB 4010/6010 includes syllabus, lecture notes, PowerPoint slides, plus the usual announcements, email, etc. The site can be reached through the UGA eLC Home Page at the following address: https://uga.view.usg.edu/. To gain access to the course, log on with your UGA MyID username and password. Information on how to use eLC is available from the UGA eLC Home Page.

Email Policy: You are responsible for any class information that is disseminated through eLC email, so you should check it frequently. Be aware that with email forwarding, you can receive emails from eLC in your preferred email account, BUT you CANNOT simply reply to the message if you are not logged into the eLC email program. This because eLC is set up to prevent spam. You can use our email addresses at the top the syllabus if you need to contact us.

Accommodations for Disabilities: If you plan to request accommodations for a disability, please register with the Disability Resource Center. They can be reached by visiting Clark Howell Hall, calling 706-542-8719 (voice) or 706-542-8778 (TTY), or by visiting http://drc.uga.edu.)

Quizzes The grading in this course will be based on weekly quizzes, given during the Monday breakout. The quiz will last ~30-45 minutes, and consist of 6-12 questions broken down as follows:
1) (~35 points) quiz questions based on the previous week's lecture. 2) (~15 points) 2-4 quiz questions based on any material that has been covered in the course,
including the previous lectures (to enhance retention). Quizzes will not be returned. Answers will be discussed following the quiz. If you believe there has been a grading error on your quiz you have one week from the date the quiz grade is posted to contact us for grade changes. No grades will be changed after this date.

Make-up quizzes and Optional Final: There will be no make-ups for missed quizzes. Instead, all students have the option of taking a semi-cumulative `Optional Final' at the end of the course. This optional final can also be used by any student to replace any quiz grade. If a student has a written excuse from a Doctor (or prior approval from the Professor) for missing a quiz, then that student may use the optional final to replace two quiz grades (the missed quiz and one additional).

Grading:

14 quizzes (50 points each)

If necessary, quizzes will be scaled

(37.5 points). on this scale.

For example, if you have earned 500 points by your 12th quiz, then you need 144 points total from the 3
remaining quizzes to earn an A. *Warning: With the scaling, it is possible to score an `A' by the 14th quiz. To discourage students from
dropping the last quiz, you must earn at least 25 points on the last quiz to receive an A in the course.

If you test positive for COVID-19 at any time, you are required to report it through the DawgCheck Test Reporting Survey. We encourage you to stay at home if you become ill or until you have excluded COVID-19 as the cause of your symptoms. UGA adheres to current Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) quarantine and isolation guidance and requires that it be followed. Follow the instructions provided to you when you report your positive test result in DawgCheck.
Guidelines for COVID-19 Quarantine Period (As of 8/1/21; follow DawgCheck or see DPH website for most up-to-date recommendations) Students who are fully vaccinated do not need to quarantine upon exposure unless they have symptoms of COVID-19 themselves. All others should follow the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) recommendations:
Students who are not fully vaccinated and have been directly exposed to COVID-19 but are not showing symptoms should self-quarantine for 10 days. Those quarantining for 10 days must have been symptom-free throughout the monitoring period and continue self-monitoring for COVID-19 symptoms for a total of 14 days. You should report the need to quarantine on DawgCheck (https://dawgcheck.uga.edu/), and communicate directly with your faculty to coordinate your coursework while in quarantine. If you need additional help, reach out to Student Care and Outreach (sco@uga.edu) for assistance.
Students, faculty and staff who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 are no longer required to quarantine if they have been fully vaccinated against the disease and show no symptoms.

Grading and Testing Policy There will be a combination of assignments and examinations involved in calculating the final grade. Reading Circles assignments (role sheets, reflection paper, participation grade) may be made up, but will only be accepted if there is a University accepted excused documentation. Any excused make-up Reading Circles assignments will be due by the next class or at the discretion of the instructor. There will be no make-up exams. Everyone must take the final comprehensive examination. With respect to the final exam, you may use this final exam to replace your lowest exam grade ONLY if you receive a 70 or above on the final. Furthermore, if you have an A in the course before the final, you may exempt the final. This

rule applies only if you have an A (not if you are simply satisfied with your grade). Upon receiving a returned assignment, there is a 24 hour policy in which you must wait before coming to talk to me about the grade to allow time for processing the grade.

Frequently Asked Questions

Exams Exams will begin promptly at the start of class. No late admittance will be accepted on exam days after the first person has completed the exam. There will be no make-up exams. With respect to the final cumulative exam, you may use this final exam to replace your lowest exam grade ONLY if you receive a 70 or above on the final.

Reading Circles Reading Circles is an activity that will help you learn how to read articles in a different manner. Articles may come from peer-reviewed journals or they may be from magazines (i.e. Science Daily, Scientific American). You will be expected to complete the reading prior to Reading Circles in class, and you will be expected to fill out your role sheet prior to class as well. There will be a total of 6 Reading Circles throughout the semester. Reading Circles will consist of 6-7 group members, and you will be assigned a different role for each Reading Circles day. You will complete each role at least once. Your Reading Circles group will remain the same throughout the semester. Your group members will be the ones to grade you on your participation, however, the instructor will have the final word on the participation grade. I will be grading the handouts and the final Reading Circles Reflection Paper. This paper will be at least 2 pages long (doublespaced, Times New Roman, font size 12) and you will be required to answer several questions pertaining to Reading Circles. 5 points will be deducted for every day the reflection paper and participation grades are turned in late. The last day to turn the paper and participation grades in will be the day of the final.

GENE4500/6500 - Human genetics - Spring 2017 Syllabus - Jan 5, 2017

The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.

Instructor:

Dr. Mary Bedell 706-542-0288

C110 Davison Life Sciences bedell@uga.edu Office hours by appointment

Class time and location: 9:30 - 10:45 TR, 145 Science Learning Center.

Prerequisite: GENE3200. Knowledge of the basic principles of classical, molecular, and population genetics is expected. Although these topics will be reviewed, you are expected to know these principles and apply them in your readings of the research papers.

Course objectives: Students will gain an understanding of the following concepts relating to human genetics: the human genome; patterns of inheritance and pedigree analysis; mapping and identification of disease genes; molecular, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms of genetic disease; animal models of human genetic disorders; genetic basis for phenotypic variation, and ethical issues. Students will gain on understanding of methods and experimental approaches used to dissect molecular processes involved in human disease and phenotypic variation. Successful students will have developed a strong foundation for continued medical studies and/or research in biomedical sciences at the graduate level.

Course material: A textbook is not required but reference textbooks are available from the instructor. In addition, links to general information will be provided for some topics.

 All assigned readings (book chapter, primary research papers, and research review articles) as well as optional (supplemental) papers, will be available on eLC. Lecture slides, which will contain both background information and specific information that relates to the assigned readings, and study guides will be available on eLC.

Class format: The assigned review articles contain important background information for the primary research paper. For each assigned primary research paper, you will be expected to understand the overarching theme of the research, the hypothesis (or hypotheses) being tested, the experimental approach(es), and the main conclusions of the research. In addition, you should be able to interpret and critically evaluate the experimental results, and formulate additional hypotheses/questions that need to be addressed.

Attendance and class participation: Attendance at each class will be recorded and will count toward your grade (see next page). Students are expected to read the assigned papers before class and should be prepared to answer questions from the instructor. You are NOT expected to understand all aspects of the papers on your own. Class times (lecture and discussions) are designed to help you understand the concepts and experimental approaches. In addition, there will be multiple in-class activities where students will work in small groups to critically assess and discuss the research papers.

 In-class, students will be asked questions on basic concepts, the rationale and experimental approach, and interpretation of results and conclusions in the papers. You are not expected to know all the answers! The questions are designed to encourage critical thinking and to help you apply concepts, not to embarrass you. Don't be shy during class or embarrassed that you don't know something!

Quizzes: There will be 10 quizzes that will be given either in class or at home through eLC. These quizzes are designed to encourage you to read the assigned papers before class, as well as to develop your critical thinking skills and improve understanding of key concepts and experimental approaches. The top 8 quiz scores will be used to calculate your grade (see next page).

GENE4500 - Spring 2017

Exams: There will be three 100-pt exams that will be based on material in assigned readings (book chapters, research, and review papers) and lecture slides. Although the exams will be noncumulative and will test primarily on topics since the preceding exam, much of the knowledge needed for these exams is cumulative.

 If a student has an excused absence, a make-up exam will be given at a day and time to be arranged and within one week of the original exam. Questions and problems on the make-up exam will NOT be the same as the original test. Requests for an excused absence will be considered on a case-by-case basis by Dr. Bedell. In order to obtain an excused absence, you will have to provide written documentation for your absence. If you don't obtain an excused absence, you will not be allowed to take a make-up exam and the missed exam will be scored as a zero.

Grades. The total course score will be calculated based on the following distribution:

Three exams Top 8 quizzes Class participation and quizzes Course/instructor evaluations

300 pts 80 pts 20 pts 2 bonus pts

Scores will be totaled and then divided by 400 pts to calculate course percentage
GENE4500H students: In addition to exams, quizzes, etc (see above), a term paper (8-to-10 pages) that provides a review and critique of a recent research paper is required for GENE4500H credit. The first part of the term paper should be written in a style like a "Preview" or "News and Views" or "Perspective". For the second part of the term paper, you will propose a hypothesis and experimental approach to follow up on experiments in the published research paper. The research paper will be chosen in consultation with Dr. Bedell and should relate to a topic in human genetics that we've discussed in this course. More details about the research proposal will be provided.

 Your choice of research paper must be approved by Dr. Bedell by Friday April 14.

 Your term paper must be uploaded to eLC by 5:00 pm on Friday April 28.

 In addition to the scores above, the term paper will count 100 pts out of a total of 500 pts.

Tentative grading scale. The course percentages shown below should be used a rough guide, actual grades will be curved relative to the performance of the entire class.

Grade A AB+ B BC+ C D F

Course percentage 93 - 100 90 - 92.9 87 - 89.9 83 - 86.9 80 - 82.9 77 - 79.9 70 - 76.9 60 - 69.9 < 60

Academic honesty: As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty," and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: https://ovpi.uga.edu/academichonesty/academic-honesty-policy. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the Dr. Bedell.

Class schedule, assigned readings, lecture slides, and study guides
This is a tentative schedule for assigned readings and lecture topics. Changes in assigned readings will be announced in class and posted on eLC. However, it is very unlikely that the dates for the three exams will be changed.
All assigned readings and supplemental material are available on eLC. Lectures slides will be posted AFTER each lecture.

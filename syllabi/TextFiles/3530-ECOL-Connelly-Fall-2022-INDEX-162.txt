Prerequisites: BIOL 1104 or (BIOL 1108 and BIOL 1108L)

Overview This 3 credit-hour course is an introduction to the rapidly expanding field of conservation biology. We will cover the foundational principles of conservation biology, and use case studies to illustrate these principles in practice. The goals of the course are as follows:
(i) To understand what biodiversity is, how it is measured and valued, and how biodiversity changes through time via speciation and extinction.
(ii) To recognize the principal current threats to biodiversity, and how these threats are mitigated. (iii) To understand the practice and complexity of preserving biodiversity and ecosystem function
through a multi-disciplinary lens and applied case studies. (iv) To be familiar with how species are monitored, and actions taken to maintain the viability of
threatened populations.

Readings Some classes have accompanying readings from the scientific literature to be read before the class period; these form the basis of in-class paper discussions, quizzes and homeworks. Required readings will be announced in the prior class period and uploaded to eLC.

Attendance and illness-related absence To achieve the highest grades in this class, regular in-person attendance is expected. Attendance is assessed by quizzes in each module, based on the lecture or reading material, together comprising 20% of your final grade. In the event that you display COVID-like symptoms, we ask you to stay home, get tested, and email the class TA in advance of the class so arrangements can be made to make up any missed quizzes. If you do test positive, stay at home for 5 days following this result - do not attend class during this period even if you feel OK. For serious illnesses or other crises that result in you missing multiple classes, we will ask you to contact the TA and instructor(s) for the classes you have missed. Note that we may need to ask you to provide proof of the emergency (such as a doctor's note) to the class TA.

Evaluation Grades will be based on class participation (20%; based on unannounced in-class quizzes), individual coursework (30%), three mid-term exams (30%), and a group project (20%). If you do not complete the in-class or pre-class activities, it will be very difficult for you to do well in this class.

The mid-term exam dates are set (Sept. 15/ Oct. 18/ Nov. 22). Students can miss any one of the three exams for any reason without any penalty. If a student completes all three exams, the lowest exam score will be dropped. Make-up exams will only be allowed in a rare instance where a student experiences very serious and on-going personal illness or an immediate family emergency on the date of the exam and who meet all of the following requirements: 1) Student must notify the TA of the reason for their absence prior to the

exam, 2) Student must provide official documentation of serious personal illness or immediate family emergency, and 3) If the documentation is confirmed, the make-up exam will be taken at the earliest possible date following the scheduled exam. The exam may differ from the class exam, and may be entirely essay based.
Your grade for the group projects will be based on a combination of individual contributions to the project and the overall group score. Each group will create a presentation to be delivered to the class in the last week of class. Projects will be graded on the basis of delivery, content, quality and clarity of the accompanying slides. As part of your individual contribution score, and instead of a final exam, everyone will write a short reflection based on the group presentations. This reflection is due in eLC by the end of the day on Friday December 9th.
The plus/minus grading system will be used, according to UGA policy. This course grading will strictly follow this plus/minus grading scale: A = 93-100, A- = 90-92.9, B+ = 87-89.9, B = 83-86.9, B- = 80-82.9, C+ = 77-79.9, C = 73-76.9, C-= 70-72.9, D = 60-69.9, F = <60. We are providing opportunities to enhance your grade (i.e., dropped exam score). Therefore, all grades are final and cannot be rounded up at the end of the semester.
Honors option: Honors students wishing to pursue an honors option can write a term paper based on a book or collection of scientific papers on a topical issue in conservation biology. The topic and the readings must be agreed with an instructor prior to the midterm break. Papers are due by the last class period of the semester.
Office hours Office hours are scheduled by appointment only. Please contact instructors or the class TA with questions relating to material from their modules at the email addresses listed above.
Accommodations Please contact Dr. Hall if you require special accommodations due to learning disabilities, religious practices, physical or medical needs.
General Notes (i) All academic work must meet the standards contained in the University's Academic Honesty Policy. Students must follow the UGA Honor Code: "I will be academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others", and are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work. Please familiarize yourselves with the guidelines on academic honesty found here: http://honesty.uga.edu/ (ii) The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructors may be necessary. Changes to the class schedule will be announced in class and on eLC announcements, and an updated schedule uploaded to eLC. Make sure you receive notifications of eLC announcements to your email.

(2010, Second edition)

The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations will be announced to the class.

Attendance. The following is from the University of Georgia Bulletin:

"Students are expected to attend class regularly. A student who incurs an excessive number of absences may be withdrawn (WF) from a class at the discretion of the professor."

Attendance is essential. Please make every effort to attend all classes.

Academic Honesty. The following is UGA's Honor Code from the University of Georgia Bulletin:

"I will be academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others."

Academic honesty means performing all academic work without plagiarism, cheating, lying, tampering, stealing, receiving unauthorized or illegitimate assistance from any other person, or using any source of information that is not common knowledge.

Incidents of academic dishonesty in this class will be reported to the VP for Instruction.

Course Grade: The geology and biology portions of the class will each count for 45% of your course grade, with 10% based on a writing assignment dealing with the field trip to Cloudland Canyon and environs. The 45% of the geology will be apportioned as follows:

Comprehensive Exam (take home)

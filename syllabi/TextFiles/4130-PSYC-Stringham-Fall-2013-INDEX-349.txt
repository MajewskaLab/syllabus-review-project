The objective of this course is to provide a detailed introduction to biological psychology. We will explore the biological and physiological mechanisms that underlie human and non-human behavior, and use that knowledge for clinical and practical applications. Lectures and readings will initially focus on anatomy, the nervous system, the senses, and the effects of psychoactive drugs, and then progress to utilize that fundamental knowledge to explain behavior (such as emotion, stress, and sleep).

Classroom experience and readings

Students should read the assigned material before class and come to class prepared to discuss that material. Since this course may be more technical than some other psychology courses, I encourage students to contact me with questions often. I check my email a lot, so feel free to ask questions via email at any time. I also encourage you to meet with other students to discuss the readings, exams, or assignments. Also, please don't text or play on your computer during class, it is distracting to other students, and I reserve the right to ask you to leave class because of it. You may think that you're being sneaky but, even though I do not have the powers of "mind control," "brain control,‚Äù or have eyes in the back of my head, I can tell, just ask my sister.

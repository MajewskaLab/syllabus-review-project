Course Description

Required Text

The purpose of this course is to examine how organisms sense and perceive their environment. We will (1) consider the philosophical questions that humans have long posed about perception, and study the methods and techniques scientists use to try to answer them; (2) debunk common misconceptions related to sensory systems and phenomenological experiences; (3) study the sensory pathways, fundamental perceptual processing, and higher-level system functionality; (4) investigate the many human sensory systems including vision, audition, gustation, olfaction, tactile sensation, nociception, temperature perception, proprioception, vestibular system, exteroception, and time perception; and (5) consider sensation and perception from physiological, psychophysical, ecological, motivational, and computational perspectives in order to have the diversity of information to examine multi-sensory perceptual processes.

Prerequisites:

PSYC 2990 or PSYC 3990

Main Course Objectives: (i.e., "By the end of this semester, I should be able to...")

 Think like a sensation and perception researcher! o Gain a general understanding and appreciation of sensory/perceptual systems. o Have an understanding of the general anatomy, processes, and functions of different systems. o Be able to engage in meaningful discussions of current approaches to sensation and perception. o Understand the role of theories and models in the study of sensation and perception. o Understand how models are used to generate new psychological knowledge. o Understand how experimental data relate to theories and models of sensory/perceptual processes.

 Discriminate between "good science" and "bad science" o Learn how to critically analyze research and apply this information to a variety of scenarios.
o Learn how to use this information to positively affect your day-to-day life.

Requirements:
I. Exams - There will be 4 exams that will test your knowledge of the material covered in the textbook, class lectures,
discussions, and activities. We will discuss the textbook material in class, but you are required to read the textbook as well. Textbook chapters should be read prior to the class they will be discussed. Sometimes it is difficult to adequately cover all of the valuable information in a chapter given our limited class time. Therefore reading beforehand allows you to ask questions in class about content that may not come up in the lecture. Just because we do not discuss something in class does not mean it cannot appear on the exam. Any material in the assigned chapters is fair game. Exams will consist of two parts: (1) a closed book, closed notes multiple choice in-class exam to be taken individually worth 85% of the total exam grade and (2) a closed book, closed notes group exam of various designs worth the remaining 15%.
II. Participation - As the sensory-psychologist-in-training that each of you now are, you will be held responsible for
coming to class prepared. To accomplish this, each of you need to review the material we will be covering that day and be ready to contribute to any discussions and activities. This syllabus gives a day-by-day breakdown of our schedule. Your participation grade will come from (1) an individual quiz using all of the "Check Your Understanding" questions from each chapter which must be turned in during class on the day we begin that chapter (see Class Schedule; quiz will be graded on accuracy and effort based on my discretion), and (2) in-class assignments, activities, and homework throughout the semester. How the quizzes and other assignments will be weighted for the final participation grade will be determined later in the semester. Therefore all assignments, activities, and quizzes should be taken seriously.
Attendance, Absences, and Additional Policies:
I. Attendance alone will not affect your grade; however, you are responsible for all information communicated in class. In some classes I will specify important information or go over material in a way that is not presented in the textbook. If you miss a class, you must get this information from one of your classmates. Do not e-mail me or come to my office and ask what you missed or if I can re-teach you something.
II. If you miss an exam or due date, you must have a valid excuse (to be determined at my discretion; e.g., excused by a medical or psychological professional, excused by student affairs committee). Contact me ASAP in this situation.
III. If you foresee a scheduling conflict with the exam schedule and the conflict is reasonable based on my discretion (e.g., jury duty, more than two exams that day), let me know at least 2 weeks prior to the exam day to arrange another day to take the exam. Failure to do so will result in a zero for that exam.
IV. No in-class assignments or activities (for participation credit or extra credit) can be "made up" or replaced with an alternate assignment. There will be in-class activities that are not mentioned on the syllabus. You must be in class to receive credit.
V. All assignments must be physically turned in by the end of class for credit. Late assignments will not be accepted.
VI. Typed assignments must be (1) printed, (2) stapled (if more than one page), and (3) brought to class for full credit. Emailed assignments will only be accepted for full credit with an excused absence (see above) and still must be received by the end of class the day the assignment is due.
Incomplete:
A grade of incomplete is only assigned in extremely unusual circumstances. Such situations require extensive documentation and approval of faculty supervisors. It is only an option if a student is passing the class and is typically only awarded when a student has completed the majority of the classwork and is only missing one or two exams or assignments. If a grade of incomplete is approved, a written plan for completion of the coursework must be developed by the instructor and student and approved by the faculty supervisor.
Academic Honesty:
As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty," and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: www.uga.edu/honesty. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.
Disability Services:
If you have a disability and require reasonable classroom accommodations, please see me after class or make an appointment during office hours.

PARTICIPATION

 All grades are rounded to the nearest hundredth decimal. Any "curving" will be decided at the end of the semester and is unlikely to occur unless the grade distribution suggests it is needed.
 "Extra credit" will only be offered for certain in-class activities (e.g., the Final Jeopardy Showdown). These points may be added to exams, assignments, or even to your final grade. How these points will be allocated will be explained prior to or during the activity. In-class activates may occur on days that are not listed on the syllabus. If you are not in class for the activity, no makeup activity will be offered.

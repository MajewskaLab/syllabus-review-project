Textbooks and Materials (Recommended but not Required)
- "Vertebrates: Comparative Anatomy, Function, Evolution" 6th ed. Kenneth V. Kardong

Grading: There are 100 points available in the course.  Lecture Quizzes: Four lecture quizzes (all are cumulative)  PowerPoint Presentation  Participation  Lecture Final Quiz (comprehensive) Wed., Dec. 12th at12:00 noon  Lab grade

(40 pts.) (8 pts.) (7 pts.) (15 pts.) (30 pts.)

- Lecture Quizzes: A lecture quiz or the Final Quiz may include "fill in the blanks", "critique", "sketch", "discuss", "compare and contrast", "multiple choice" questions, .... etc. Lecture quizzes will cover notes given in class and pertinent information from the textbook. Some class notes will come from sources other than the text. Lecture quizzes are kept by instructor. - If you would like to see your graded lecture quiz, you may stop by my office during my office hours. Lecture quizzes represent 40% of final course grade.
- PowerPoint Presentation: In-class learning includes a student-centered, active learning component. Students will prepare and present PowerPoint presentations. Presentations start September 10, 2012. The underlying goal is for students to develop skills to communicate a primary topic to a scientifically literate audience. Make sure that you post your ppt. presentation on the "Discussion Board" of eLC site by the day of your presentation. Please, see eLC homepage for detailed presentation assignments and schedule. PowerPoint presentation represents 8% of final course grade.
- Participation: Short assessments may be administered and class roll may be taken at any time of any class. Please, be punctual. We'll use clickers "Turning Technologies ResponseCard NXT" mainly as assessment of your learning and participation. Please, remember that holding more

than one clicker, or having clicker data show up for a class where the student was not physically present are acts of academic dishonesty and will be strictly treated as such. I'll drop three "zeros" to cover issues such as dead batteries, lost clicker, forgotten clickers, etc. Participation represents 7% of final course grade.
- Final Quiz: Comprehensive. Wed. 12/12 at12:00 noon; represents 15% of final course grade.
- LAB: Lab represents 30% of final course grade. Please, refer to Lab Syllabus.

Make-up quizzes: - There will be NO make-ups for missed quizzes. Documented emergencies (from hospitals, police departments, courts, funeral homes ...etc.) are submitted to me. I may forward the documents to Students' Dean Office for inspection and verification. In case your documented emergency is verified and approved by the Dean's office, your Final Exam score will replace the "0" received as a score for the missed quiz. Final Exam is cumulative, typically includes critical thinking questions, and is administered during the official Final Exam day (Wednesday December 12, 2012 at 12:00 noon).

Extra credit assignments: - There will be NO extra credit assignments.

Final Letter Grade
Your grade in this course is determined by your performance on class tests and assignments. There is no curve. Standard cutoffs are used to assign grades. The grade of an Incomplete is assigned only with the recommendation of the Office of Student Affairs. Any student convicted of academic dishonesty will receive a grade of "F". Those that do not will receive a failing grade regardless of their total course average. Final letter grade is assigned as follows:

> 90 = A

88.00 - 89.99 = A-

86.00 - 87.99 = B+

80.00 - 85.99 = B

78.00 - 79.99 = B-

76.00 - 77.99 = C+

70.00 - 75.99 = C

68.00 - 69.99 = C-

60.00 - 67.99 = D

< 60.00 = F

OFFICIAL COURSE POLICIES:
Proper conduct in class is a must. If you choose to engage in a conduct that is disruptive to other students, you will be asked to immediately leave the classroom for the remainder of the class period. Repeated improper conduct will result in you facing an administrative withdrawal from class.

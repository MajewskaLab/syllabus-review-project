Good news this class is supported by PLAdawgs PLAdawgs are students who successfully took this course in a previous semester and are returning this semester to support you and your learning They have received

special training on how people learn and how to be an effective resource for you In addition they will meet regularly with your instructor to understand how to best support your learning in this course PLAdawgs are not here to reteach the material nor to provide you with the answers nor to evaluate your work They do not grade assignments or exams and are not teaching assistants TAs PLAdawgs are here specifically to help you learn by enhancing discussions and activities in this class They will help you get the most out of classroom activities by clarifying instructions and assisting you in finding the right questions to deepen your learning So get to know your PLAdawgs and take advantage of their training on your journey to academic success

Top Hat Community is a free community platform that allows us to remotely communicate with everyone across our university keeping our campus connected We will be using Top Hat Community for course announcements and group work throughout the course It is also a great way to ask questions of your classmates PLAs and Dr Robinson

Each week, four students that post will be randomly selected and get to pick one of the following:
24 hour late submission for one case study 24 hour late submission for one day's Top Hat questions up to 5 questions Feedback on 1 case study when it is not your turn Feedback on your study guide before an exam Co ee & chat with Dr. Robinson at the Creamery

Top Hat Community App Logo

In order to make sure that case feedback is shared with groups in a timely manner by 8pm the day before the exam you must share case feedback when it is given to you with your group before the exam You must either copy paste the feedback or share screen shots in your group s Top Hat Community channel Failure to

post case feedback in a timely manner will result in a deduction of 3 points from your highest exam in this course
How to join Top Hat Community Before proceeding make sure that you have created a Top Hat account and enrolled in our Top Hat course using the steps linked above
Step 1 Go to https login tophatblue com click Login in with Top Hat and input your Top Hat account credentials Step 2 Check your school email for a message from Top Hat Community to verify your email address Step 3 Once directed back to Slate input your real name in the username field when prompted Step 4 Locate our course channel in the left side menu
You will be automatically added to our course channel upon entry to Top Hat Community If you ever need to re join our course channel manually click the globe icon in the top left menu and search the channel title 301478 in the channel directory

C e De c i i a d Objec i e
In this co rse e ill e plore the chemistr of life
This course has been designed to facilitate your learning of the topics of biochemistry and molecular biology During our semester together we will work on case studies which have been chosen not only for the material they will teach you but also to give you a chance to develop problem solving skills and scientific reasoning You will learn about biochemical concepts and principles such as the chemical properties of the cellular environment the thermodynamics and kinetics of biochemical reactions metabolic pathways and how they are regulated and the structure and function of biomolecules You will not be expected to memorize the twenty amino acids that make up the proteins in our bodies nor will you be asked to write the Krebs cycle from memory Rather you should be able to use information about amino acids and metabolism to answer broader questions about biochemistry

By the end of this course students should be able to

1 Combine concepts in enzymology and bioenergetics to describe the biological processes of protein folding and foundations for metabolism
2 Integrate your prior knowledge in biology and chemistry to explain the detailed structure and function of four macromolecules proteins carbohydrates lipids and nucleic acids
3 Integrate intermediary metabolism which forms the basis of life for all organisms We will specifically focus on glucose fat and amino acid metabolism in humans
4 Utilize knowledge of nucleic acid structure and the processes of transcription and translation to explain human diseases and cutting edge molecular biology technologies
5 Demonstrate skills in scientific reasoning and problem solving by reading and analyzing primary literature

Ae e
The best a to be s ccessf l is to complete ALL readings and assignments

I expect you to take charge of your learning in this class There is not enough time for us to cover every detail of biochemistry during class therefore you will have to do some learning on your own You should expect to keep up with the course schedule work together with your group and seek help when needed Learning is not a spectator sport

Your final grade will be calculated in eLC, and will be updated at least after every exam. Your grade in Top Hat is an accurate calculation of your current course grade, so check eLC.

Pre Assessment Quizzes 7

There will be approximately one quiz per week associated with reading assignments The quizzes must be completed BEFORE the case study

http clipart library com clipart 1579878 htm

begins These are open book and are mainly multiple choice and graded for correctness You may collaborate

with your assigned group to answer the questions Your lowest score will be dropped. Because the pre

assessments are open for at least 1 week no late submissions or excusals will be given

Case Studies 7

There will be approximately one case study per week and there are no dropped grades for this category Case studies are due 11 59PM on the day that we discuss the case during class These assignments will require you

to apply knowledge you have gained from the reading and class discussion to real life scenarios All case studies will be turned in on Top Hat graded for completion and effort Each student will be working in a group with 3 4 other students to complete the case study though each student is still responsible for submitting their own assignment

Each case study 1 of the group members will receive feedback on their case answers which should be shared with the group In order to make sure that case feedback is shared with groups in a timely manner you must share case feedback when it is given to you with your group before the exam You must either copy paste the feedback or share screen shots in your group s Top Hat Community channel Failure to post case feedback will result in a deduction of 3 points from your highest exam in this course

Participation 7

https gph is g aQd1bjB

A 90 or above in this category equals 100 Participation includes answering Top Hat questions and completing any in class activities including practice exams You must be present in class to receive these points If you have an excused absence send me documentation to be excused from that day s points Yo ill be most s ccessf l in this class if o attend class in person so please make e er effort to attend Do NOT come to class if you have a fever or experiencing any COVID like symptoms If o are nable to make it to class o can still join in ith o r gro p to ork on the case sing Top Hat Comm nit s ideo chat or other app

Exams 79

There are 4 unit exams in this class, each weighted the same. Each of the 4 unit exams will consist of a take home portion and an in class portion. The weight of the in class vs the take home may vary but will be about 60 in class 40 take home

Take home exam: Given as an assignment in Top Hat Available one week before the deadline and due at 11 59PM two days before the in class exam except for exam 2 when the deadline is 1 day after the exam due to Spring Break This gives you the opportunity to apply your understanding of biochemistry to novel problems The format is mainly free response and may include drawing or graphing Take home exams will have questions that you answer individually as well as questions to work on as a group.

In class exam: Closed book these will include multiple choice click on target fill in the blank questions These will be in given in class using Top Hat with live proctoring All in class exams will be taken individually.

Your lowest exam from exams 1 3 will be dropped. As exam 4 is partially cumulative with regard to metabolism it will not be dropped

Credit Hours: 4 Lecture times: Mon, Wed, Fri, 10:20 am - 11:10, Synchronous online Breakout times: Thursdays 2:15-3:30 pm or 4:00-5:15 pm, Synchronous online; please check your schedule for your assigned time. Pre- / co-requisites: Biochemistry (BCMB/BIOL 3100) is a pre-requisite for this course, Genetics (GENE/BIOL 3200) is a pre- or co-requisite.
Course material Textbook: "Molecular Biology of the Cell" by Alberts et al, 6th edition, Garland Publishing, 2015 Additional material will be posted on the courses eLC page: https://uga.view.usg.edu/ We will make every effort place updated lecture handouts on eLC two hours prior to class time. Reading the relevant textbook sections (as indicated in the schedule) before each class is highly recommended.
Course description The course objective is to learn about how cells live, differentiate and reproduce. Modern cell biology is an integrative science based on the knowledge derived from diverse fields including microscopy, biochemistry, genetics, physiology and even bioinformatics. Our understanding of cellular mechanisms is based primarily on observations made in the course of experiments. Thus, we will attempt to cover both our current models of cellular functions as well as the experimental basis for their formulation. The course activities are designed to enhance development of skills that will be essential for success in future degree programs.
Course goals · To learn about key cellular structures, processes and mechanisms, as foundational knowledge required for understanding current research in cell biology. · To appreciate that cell biology is a dynamic discipline, in which knowledge is based on experimental findings and concepts are changed or refined in light of new information. · To learn how new information is obtained in cell biology and to survey methods for answering open questions about cells.

Grading Over the semester, you will accumulate points through participation in breakout sessions, in-class activities, and four written exams. The total number of accumulated points will be used to determine your grade. If the point average is below 390 (83%), the instructors may adjust the average final GPA of the class up to 2.9 ("curving"). You can view your accumulated points at any time on eLC (https://uga.view.usg.edu/ ). Overview of point allocation:

4 exams (100 points each): Breakout sessions: In-class activities: Total:

400 points 50 points 20 points
470 points

Breakout sessions (50 points) Our schedule includes 10 breakout sessions meant to provide you with an opportunity for enhancing your understanding of the material covered in class. Students will work in small groups on problem sets, review difficult concepts, practice problem solving, and engage in other learning activities. Breakouts are mandatory, and active participation is valued at 50 points total. Up to 5 points can be earned per breakout session. Online quizzes: For some of the breakout sessions, you may be asked to complete an online quiz or questionnaire. These quizzes are not mandatory and won't be graded (although you may receive comments on eLC); they serve to prepare you for the breakout material and as an assessment tool for the instructors.

In-class activities / participation (20 points) You will have an opportunity to earn points by participating in activities related to the lecture material, such as written answers to a questionnaire or group activities. Points are awarded for an honest effort, not for correct answers. These activities also serve to help the instructors spot and address any difficulties the class may have with the material early (that is, before the exam).

Exams (100 points each, 400 points total) Exams will focus on concepts and mechanisms highlighted in lecture and covered in the accompanying textbook readings for the respective section, but can also include material from the breakout sessions. Students are expected not only to recall important facts about the covered material, but to also to synthesize, apply and evaluate the information. All exams will be online and open book; however, sharing the answers to these exams via messaging apps is not aaceptable. Format: Quizzes will consist largely of short answer or essay questions. Dates: See schedule. Make-up exams: Should a medical emergency or other pressing obligation prevent you from participating in one of the exams, you will have the opportunity of completing a makeup exam. In case of pressing obligations, such as a scientific meeting, a UGA-sponsored field trip, or an interview at a professional / graduate school, please make sure you obtain written consent by the instructor in advance of the exam you want to miss (email is fine). In case of medical emergencies, please provide the instructor with written documentation by the physician's office or a qualified health care professional.

Honors option Students may sign up for the Honors option in this class using the forms available at the Honors office. The Honors assignment is to write two paper reviews in the format outlined below; please make sure to adhere to the deadlines! 1. Select a recent research paper related to the course material from these Journals:
Journal of Cell Biology, Nature Cell Biology, Molecular Biology of the Cell Contact the instructor handling your paper to get approval for your selection. The instructors will be happy to help you selecting a paper upon request. 2. Write a two-page report (1.5 line space) that should include: 1) title, authors, source, and digital object identifier (doi) of the research article 2) main questions or hypotheses addressed in the paper 3) experimental approach(es) utilized, and salient results 4) major conclusions of the study (take-home message) 5) your comments on the experimental design and conclusions Clear reasoning, concise writing, and a statement of your own judgment are required. The following questions may serve as a guide: Why is the study significant? Are the approaches suited to answering the question posed? Are important control experiments in place? Do the results support the conclusions? 2. Deadlines and handling instructors:
February 12th: draft of first paper due to DK, handling instructor. April 15th: draft of second paper due to CS, handling instructor. Please email an electronic copy of your draft by these deadlines. Instructors may accept the paper as is or ask for revisions, for example in case of factual errors. Revisions need to be completed within two weeks of the submission deadline.
Academic Honesty It is expected that all students in this course will work in accordance with University guidelines regarding academic honesty, and the Student Honor Code: "I will be academically honest in all of my academic work and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others." Issues related to academic honesty will be handled strictly according to policies and procedures available at: http://ovpi.uga.edu/academic-honesty/academic-honestypolicy. Accessing notes of any kind and/or ANY use of unauthorized asssistance during tests are violations that will be reported. The Honor Code states that students must report cheating by other students on any assignment, quiz, or exam in this course.

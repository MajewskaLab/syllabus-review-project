Grading Guidelines:

Examinations Examination will be based on reading assignments from your textbook and all
information presented in class. An examination will be given after the conclusion of each major area (September 14,
October 12, November 9, and December 8). The Exam IV (December 8, 1:25 - 2:15 P.M.) is NOT a comprehensive examination. In addition, quizzes (announced and/or unannounced) may be given anytime throughout the course. The grade for each major area will be computed based upon the examination grade plus any quiz grades.

Course Grade The final grade for the course will be determined by weighing the score from each of the
4 major areas (Parts I to IV) such that each Exam plus quizzes will account for 25%. Assignment of the final letter grade is based on the following guidelines:

90.0 - 92.9% A80.0 - 82.9% B70.0 - 72.9% C60.0 - 69.9% D Below 60% F

93.0 - 100% A 83.0 - 86.9% B 87.0 - 89.9% B+ 73.0 - 76.9% C 77.0 - 79.9% C+

A student with an excused absence from an examination will be retested with special arrangement by the instructor. An unexcused absence from an examination or quiz will be recorded as zero. Bring No. 2 pencils and a calculator to each exam.

Texts:

Course text: Campbell Biology, Urry  Cain  Wasserman  Minorsky  Reece, 11th edition, 2017, Pearson, NY Purchase options: eText with Mastering Biology (ISBN 9780134446523)
Loose-leaf option with Mastering Biology (ISBN 9780134454665) Hardbound option with Mastering Biology (ISBN 9780134082318) Laboratory manual: Biology 1107L/2107L: Principals of Biology I Laboratory Manual, 3rd edition. This is an online lab manual and is available at https://www.bluedoorpublishing.com/bluedoorlabs (link is also in eLC) and may be purchased directly through the publisher. You may also purchase an access code from the University Bookstore. When accessed via eLC, you will be asked to register (you will need to know your lab course CRN number). After your initial sign-on, the link will be active so your log-in to eLC will allow you to access the lab manual without signing in again. Purchase options: online purchase via Bluedoor - ISBN 978-1-68135-530-6 to purchase access cards at the UGA bookstore - 978-1-68135-529-0 Top-perforated 50 set carbonless notebook: This or its equivalent may be purchased at the campus bookstore and possibly at off-campus bookstores. It is acceptable to use carbonless notebook from another course that still has paper in it.

Lab Coordinator: Kimberly Martin, 349 Science Learning Center Phone: 542-1680, e-mail martinkim@uga.edu
Laboratory: Starts the week of August 14, 2019 Participation in this course requires concurrent enrollment in both 2107 (lecture) and 2107L
(lab) classes. Students who do not enroll in both the lecture and the lab classes or who drop either the lecture or the lab during the drop/add period without permission from the Instructor or the Biology Division will be administratively dropped from the other course as well. Students who withdraw from the course after the drop/add period will be assigned a WP or WF based on completed assignments and class participation up to the time of withdrawal.
You are required to read assigned exercises in the lab manual and any others given to you by your teaching assistant in preparation for lab. The lab course will use eLC (https://uga.view.usg.edu/) for course management.
Your graduate laboratory assistant instructors (GLA) will be Shivangi Nath (sn19732@uga.edu), Jason Marcero (jmarcero@uga.edu), or Greg Evans (gevans@uga.edu).
BIOL 2107L is a Writing Intensive Lab Course. It closely follows the guidelines established by the University of Georgia's Writing Intensive Program (WIP). Our goal in following these guidelines is to help you become better writers in your academic field of science, as writing and thinking are parallel cognitive (learning) processes. Writing engages individuals in the information being studied and therefore results in better retention of this subject material.
Safety rule - Your waist to your toes must be completely covered or you will be asked to leave lab and accrue an absence. Lab coats and goggles will be provided.

Lecture Teaching Assistant: The lecture teaching assistant, Shivangi Nath, is assigned to the course to help in grading exams. Shivangi will also review material with you and answer questions. e-mail: sn19732@uga.edu

Note: Your grades will be based entirely on exam performance; we do not offer extra credit.

Points Required for Letter Grades: A 90% - 100% B 80% - 89% C 70% - 79% D 60% - 69%

Types of Exam Question: Exams will be short and medium length answers, not multiple choice. Some of the questions on each exam will be challenging; as a science major you should learn to think about the material, not just memorize it.

Bring IDs to Exams: Bring your ID cards! IDs will be checked at each exam.

Make Up Exams: You may arrange ahead of time to take a makeup exam, provided that you have an acceptable reason (emergency or bereavement) for missing the regularly scheduled exam time. No makeup exams will be arranged after the normal time for an exam has passed, except for emergencies.

Mistakes in Grading: If we make a mistake regarding the grading, please do not be afraid to bring it to our attention; however, asking for additional points on a question will also give the instructors the option of regrading the entire exam. The cutoff date for corrections to an exam will be one week after the graded exam is returned to the class.

Cheating: Cheating is not permitted. This includes lecture and lab and covers homework as well as
in class or in lab work. Seating at exams will be controlled, and other steps will be taken as necessary to discourage cheating. Unauthorized collaborating in writing lab reports also constitutes a violation of UGA's honor code. See the honor code online at http://www.uga.edu/honesty/

Withdrawals: Withdrawals with a grade of WP may be made through October 21, 2019

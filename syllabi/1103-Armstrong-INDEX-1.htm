            will pose clicker questions everyday (except test days) throughout the

            final point total at the end of the semester (see below). To get 100% of the
            clicker points, you need to have submitted answers  to  80% of the total clicker
            questions asked during the semester. All answers, whether correct or not, are accepted.  To receive credit for your answer, you  need to program
            your clicker so I can identify who answered these questions. This is done by entering your <strong><span style='font-family:
  Arial'>UGA login name (myID) as your clicker ID</span></strong></span>. I will
            demonstrate this in class. See also the user manual that may have come with
            your clicker or the copy posted on eLC</span>. Failure to
            enter your login name correctly will mean that you will not receive credit

            answer not received) by the end of class. Only in this circumstance will you
            receive credit for class attendance. Lost clickers, clickers left in your
            room, clickers with dead batteries, or clickers that did not have your login
            name properly added will not be considered as a valid excuse for not

            tests during the semester. Most test questions will come from material
            covered during lecture and in the reading assignments. However, most

          course is to get you to learn the basics of Biology that I think you will
          need in your future lives. I use tests to encourage you to study, and thus
          learn more about Biology, but also to investigate how well you have mastered
          the material and to help determine what grade to give you. To do well on
          these tests, you should read and study on your own and be able to answer
          detailed and thought provoking questions about the material. Unfortunately,
          many students may not realize that they do not understand or are confused
          about a topic until after seeing a relevant test question. Their grade
          suffers and they are unlikely to understand the  material any better after
          taking the test than beforehand. </span></p>
          <p><span style='font-family:Arial; color:#000'>To encourage you to work together to help each other learn and understand the course materia,l you will be asked to choose a group of 5-7 people to work with during the semester (instructions on how to do this will be provided on eLC). In addition to taking individual tests and discussing topics together during class, you will be also asked to  tests together with your group.  If you
            experienced difficulty with a question on the individual portion of the exam,
            you will have the opportunity to have the questions clarified and corrected
            for you by a member of your group. The group test score will help you improve your overall course grade while the instant feedback can help you learn the material better than
            simply taking the test on your own enabling you to do better on the final exam. In a way you will be taking on the role
            of tutors for each other. Additionally, the process of explaining a concept
            or test question to other students in a group actually helps the student
            doing the explaining learn the material even better themselves. </span></p>

            or any subject. Interacting with other people is a natural way for people to
            learn, but each person must construct her or his own knowledge in the
            process. In BIOL1103, we encourage you to work and study together in and out
            of class meetings. The written materials you produce as homework, in-class
            activities, and projects will be an outcome of these interactions. However, <u>the

            in the course. If you are doing poorly on the lecture exams you need to stop
            by and talk to me as soon as possible after you get your exam back. I have 2
            office hours a week, when we can sit down and figure out a better strategy
            for your studying. Many students put this off until late in the semester when
            it is difficult to turn things around. There is also free tutoring available

            else. Changing your grade simply because you need a higher score is in
            violation of the &quot;Culture of Honesty&quot; quidelines</span> of the University. A few extra credit opportunities will be available
            throughout the semester that can help you improve your overall average.
            However, the best way to improve your grade is to make sure that you complete
            all assignments in a timely and conscientiuous manner.</p>

Commitment to Intersectionality
We would like to acknowledge that we are all individuals with multiple
sociocultural identities that intersect and shape our worldview through the
lens of privilege and oppression. Our commitment to you as your instructors is
to minimize systemic forces of oppression within the classroom such as
ableism, classism, racism, sexism, trans oppression, and heterosexism in
efforts to create a safe(r) learning environment for all of us. We ask that you 
also join us in this commitment to foster respect for one another, enhance
solidarity, and build community

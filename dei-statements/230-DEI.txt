College can be a rough time for a variety of reasons. If you decide you need someone to talk to, whatever the reason may be, please don't hesitate to come to me. Please know that although, I have been through Safe Space training by the UGA LGBT resource center, my office cannot be officially listed as a Safe Space (because it is a shared office)

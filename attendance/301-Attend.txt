Attendance at each class will be recorded and will count toward your grade (see next page). Students are expected to read the assigned papers before class and should be prepared to answer questions from the instructor. You are NOT expected to understand allaspects of the papers on your own. Class times (lecture and discussions) are designed to help you understand the concepts and experimental approaches. In addition, there will be multiple in-class activities where students will work in small groups to critically assess and discuss the research papers.

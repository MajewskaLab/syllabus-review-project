Attendance in lab and lab lecture is mandatory.  If you must miss a lab period, it is your responsibility to arrange to make up the class during another lab period the same week and to provide documentation of a valid excuse, otherwise the absence will be considered ‘unexcused’.  Please keep in mind that there may not be room in all of the lab sessions to accommodate extra people.  Tardy arrivals (>10 min), in which a valid excuse has not been presented, will also count as an unexcused absence.  
Any homework or in-class assessments cannot be made up if the absence in unexcused.  Medical/professional school interviews will be counted as excused absences only if the TA and instructor are contacted prior to the absence.  In order for an illness to be considered excusable, the student must submit a document from his/her physician indicating the student was to not to be attending class due to the illness – documents indicating the student simply visited the health center are not sufficient.

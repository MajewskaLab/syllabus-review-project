Attendance at lectures is a university rule, and this will also provide a measure of your participation commitment mentioned above. Whereas nearly all examination material is covered in the text, lectures do stress the details required for answering SCANTRON multiple choice questions.  Proposed exam questions are often identified in class, especially if the question is not covered in the text, such as the latitude and longitude of Athens, GA.  For all of these reasons, I strongly recommend your attendance at lectures. Laboratory attendance is absolutely mandatory; a significant portion of your lab grade depends on this participation.  Attendance at scheduled exams is very important; make-up exams are usually oral exams, requiring three or more hours of intensive two-directional discussion with me on ecological issues.

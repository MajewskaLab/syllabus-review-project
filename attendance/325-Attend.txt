Attendance: Attendance is mandatory. You may attend the other lab section and make-up assignments only with a university excused absence and approval from the instructor. For all other excuses, you will receive no credit for that weekâ€™s assignments (i.e. lab quiz, lab write-up). Attendance serves as a major portion of your laboratory credit, thus, absences can quickly negatively impact your grade.

Attendance: Regular and prompt class attendance is required. Students are expected to attendclass and attendance will count in your final grade. Students are allowed FOUR absences,regardless of the reasons for the absence. No distinction is made between excused and unexcusedabsences and no excuses for absences need be given. Your final numerical grade will be reducedby one point for each absence beyond the permitted four absences, except in the case of extrememedical need requiring complete bed rest (e.g., hospitalization) or a court order. Medical or otherappointments should not be scheduled for the class period. Habitual late arrivals will count asabsences.

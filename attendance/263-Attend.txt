Attendance: Regular and prompt class attendance is required. Students are expected to attend class and attendance will count in your final grade. Students are allowed FOUR absences, regardless of the reasons for the absence. No distinction is made between excused and unexcused absences and no excuses for absences need be given. Your final numerical grade will be reduced by one point for each absence beyond the permitted four absences, except in the case of extreme medical need requiring complete bed rest (e.g., hospitalization) or a court order. Medical or other appointments should not be scheduled for the class period. Habitual late arrivals will count as absences.

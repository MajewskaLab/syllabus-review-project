Students are expected to attend all assigned class meetings and are responsible for all content and instructions given during class time as well as announcements made on eLC.  In-class assignments and activities cannot be made up without an excused absence, absentees must provide written documentation to the course email address WITHIN 48 hrs of absence.  All excuses are subject to approval by Dr. Dustman, or the course assistants, before make-up work (quizzes and activities) is made available.  Make-up work must be completed BEFORE the next Tuesdays class meeting; make up quizzes may be entirely different than the one given in class.  If you know you have a schedule conflict, consult with Dr. Dustman or the course assistants in advance.

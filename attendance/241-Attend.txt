Attendance is expected and missing class too frequently may negatively impact your grade. I will not provide class materials to students who are absent and lack a valid medical or University-approved excuse. (An example of a valid medical excuse would be a signed and dated physician’s note, whereas an example of a University-approved excuse would be a roster and schedule for the sports team you might happen to be on.) If you miss class for any other reason, you should meet with a classmate to discuss what you missed (and to borrow any auxiliary notes). Please DON’T expect a response in such cases if you email me asking if you “missed anything.”  Any credit that was earned on the missed day (e.g. quiz grade, participation, et cetera) will not be available to you if you miss class without a valid medical or University-approved excuse (or an express, written excuse from either your TA or me). Don’t ask me to make an exception for you, because I won’t. Just plan on being in class on time every day, and it won’t   be an issue for you.

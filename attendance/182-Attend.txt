Due to the size of this class, all instruction will be given online in an synchronous manner (live lectures on zoom) and quizzes and exams will also occur online. We aim to record each lecture and post the recordings on eLC for your convenience. However, we strongly
encourage attendance in each class. Furthermore, we encourage that students keep their video on, this will help the instructors to get to know students better in an already difficult online setting and thus will improve your and our experience.

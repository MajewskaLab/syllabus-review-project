Concerning attendance and class participation, there is no formal attendance policy. This is your education, so feel free to do with it what you see fit. From personal experience, I can tell you that l've always felt better about the work I did in the courses I showed up to, and I hope you all do well in my class. I appreciate an email letting me know when you will be absent. I do, however, monitor your attendance with the use of pop quizzes. The quizzes will be based on the reading material; I will let you know in advance what I expect you to read for the quizzes. There will be no make-ups for quizzes

There will be no tracking of course attendance, and absences need not be reported to the instructors. Students are responsible, however, for all missed content. The course content and discussions build on your existing knowledge and address your questions and concerns, which are facilitated by attending class. Attendance policies in response to the Covid pandemic are dictated by The University System of Georgia (USG) guidelines (https://apps.dar.uga.edu/html emails/-/gailemail/aug-2-cv-update). At the time this syllabus was created, these guidelines allow for in person instruction. Any changes to these guidelines will be announced through eLC, UGA Archnews or other UGA communication.

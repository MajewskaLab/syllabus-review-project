Punctual attendance in the lab is required. Lecture slides and handouts will be available on the web via eLC to simplify note-taking. You are responsible for printing your own copies (you may use the printers at the Student Learning Center) and should do so before class. Having my slides with you will make note-taking easier, but additional material and examples are given in class. You will be responsible for all content and instructions given during the lecture and announcements made in class (including on days when you miss a class). Missing more than one class period: a) places a significant burden upon your laboratory partner(s); b) prevents you from gaining applied experience, a major goal of this class; and c) disrupts the continuity needed to complete multi-week experiments. Medical/professional school interviews will be counted as excused absences only if Dr. Paz is contacted prior to the absence.

Attendance: We understand and respect the fact that not all students may feel comfortable with inperson instruction, given COVID-19. Therefore, there will be no grading penalty if you chose to not attend face-to-face class lectures, even on your scheduled in-person day. If you opt to not attend class(es) in person, you will be responsible for fulfilling class requirements online. Please do not put yourself or others at risk by coming to class if you are ill or have a known exposure to COVID-19.

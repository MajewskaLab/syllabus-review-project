\f0\b \cf2 Missing labs with a valid excuse: 
\f1\b0 A \'93valid\'94 excuse is one that is written, verifiable, and covers the date and time of your scheduled lab class. Oversleeping and job conflicts do not constitute acceptable excuses. Missing a lab with a valid excuse allows you to make-up the lab provided that you contact your lab instructor within 
\f0\b 48 hours
\f1\b0  of the absence. If you know in 
\f0\b advance
\f1\b0  that you will miss a lab with a valid excuse, contact your GLA 
\f0\b before
\f1\b0  the lab for reassignment to another lab period. Make-up assignments are due within a time limit agreed to between you and your GLA and may include any or all of the following: evidence that you have consulted with your team members regarding missed work and data, completing the lab with a different section, submitting assignments associated with the missed lab, making up a lab assessment and/or by completing an alternate assignment designated by the GLA or course instructor.  Students who fail to complete the make-up work within the allocated time will not receive credit for the lab exercise. 
\f2\i You are responsible for all material and data presented and gathered in lab.

\f0\b \cf2 Missing labs without a valid excuse: 
\f1\b0 If you do not have a valid excuse for missing a lab, you will not be allowed to make up any work and will automatically receive a 
\f0\b minimum
\f1\b0  of 20-point deduction from your total lab points; if a lab is worth more than 20 points for that day, you will lose the total number of points for that day\

\f0\b \cf2 Tardiness and leaving lab early without permission
\f1\b0  are not tolerated in lab. If you arrive to lab more than 15 minutes late you will be marked as absent with a valid excuse but will be allowed to hand in work for that lab as well as stay and complete the lab. If you leave lab early without permission, you will be marked as absent without a valid excuse - even if you have completed all work for that day - and will automatically receive a 20-point deduction from your total lab points for that day.\

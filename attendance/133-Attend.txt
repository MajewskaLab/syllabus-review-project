Is in-person attendance required for ECOL3500 in the Fall 2022? Yes. The lecture portion of this course will NOT be available live over Zoom, nor will it be recorded and posted to eLC after the class. The only way to get the full course content is to attend class live and in-person during our scheduled meeting times. Attendance will not be taken.

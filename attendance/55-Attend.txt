All students are expected to attend all scheduled classes. If you miss an in-class team-based project, 
you will not be able to make-up that score, regardless of your excuse. If you miss a lecture quiz, you 
will be able to make-up that quiz if you (1) contact me within 24 hours of the quiz date and (2) provide 
a valid excuse. You must take this make-up quiz before the next scheduled class period. If you miss a 
laboratory practical, you have a choice of either receiving a score of zero on than practical, or to take 
an incomplete in the course. Due to the set up involved, it is impossible to take a make-up exam for a 
missed practical, regardless of your excuse
You are expected to attend the laboratory section for which you are scheduled. Under certain extraordinary circumstances, the laboratory coordinator may approve a change in laboratory assignment of 
provide permission to attend an alternate laboratory section.

Punctual attendance in the lab is required.  Missing more than one class period: a) places a significant burden upon your laboratory partner(s); b) prevents you from gaining applied experience, a major goal of this class; and c) disrupts the continuity needed to complete multi-week experiments. Therefore, we allow one absence in this class. Medical/professional school interviews will be counted as excused absences only if Dr. Winternitz is contacted prior to the absence.

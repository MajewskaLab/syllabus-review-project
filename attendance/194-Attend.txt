Routine attendance to class is necessary and mandatory. Studies indicate that students who regularly attend class perform significantly better than their counterparts that do not. In the event that a student does not attend class, the University of Georgia Office of the Registrar authorizes instructors to drop or withdraw a student from a course because of excessive absences. Excessive absence in this course is defined as missing 13.5% of classes. Once that period is achieved, the instructor has the authority to drop or withdraw the student.

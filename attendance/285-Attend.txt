BIOL 4300W is a series of lectures, discussions, workshops, and peer reviews that require the active involvement of everyone; therefore, attendance is required. 
Workshop participation requires that you bring work in progress and actively engage in all parts of the workshop. Failure to do so will adversely affect your Participation grade.

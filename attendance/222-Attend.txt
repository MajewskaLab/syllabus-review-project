Students are expected to attend all lectures. Lecture slides will be available on the web via eLC to simplify note-taking. However, the lecture notes on eLC should not be regarded as a substitute for attending class. Having my slides with you will make note-taking easier, but additional material and examples are given in class. You should be prepared to take notes on blank paper (or slide handout or laptop) at any time. You will be responsible for all content and instructions given during the lecture and announcements made in class (including on days when you miss a class). Please turn off all cell phones and pagers during class.

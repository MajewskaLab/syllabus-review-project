Most students find the lecture topics to be interesting. As we have no formal text, lectures will not duplicate material found elsewhere. Since students will be responsible for this information on the exams, attendance and note taking are important. Students who miss a class will still be expected to submit assignments on time. More than 6 unexcused absences from lecture or 4 unexcused absences from weekly labs may result in an automatic lowering of the final score by one letter grade. Excused absence requests should be submitted in writing prior to or immediately following an absence (these include potential exposure to Covid, feeling unwell, traveling to graduate school interviews etc.).

You are allowed two documented absences from paper discussions. There will be no make ups for these absences. Instead, your paper discussion grade will be determined from the remaining paper discussions. Note: this will NOT be reflected in TopHat, which will show zeros for the missed discussions. Official documentation (Doctor's note, Email from coach of sports team, etc) must be provided. If you miss more than two paper discussions, a make-up assignment will be given (e.g. write a summary of a scientific paper) provided the absences are documented.

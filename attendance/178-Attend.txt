Attendance Policies: Attendance is not mandatory but highly encouraged and attendance and participation in some classes is required to receive credit for some assignments. The course is structured and scaffolded under the assumption that you attend class, come prepared (e.g., having completed readings, downloaded and reviewed materials, etcâ€¦). If you have need for regular remote access due to COVID19 precautions, we ask that you register your need with the DRC. Contact us to request
access to the course Zoom feed. If you arrive late, please enter the room quietly and take the nearest seat to the entrance
while minimizing disturbance to your peers. If you anticipate being late regularly, please notify the instructor in advance and observe the policy for entering the room. Students who arrive late may be prevented from attending class if their late arrival is regular or disruptive. If you must leave class early, please sit close to an exit, minimize disruption when
packing up your materials, and exit quietly. Again, notify your instructor in advance if you expect to leave early regularly.

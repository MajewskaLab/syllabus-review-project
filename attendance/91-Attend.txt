Attendance in this class is mandatory.  Missing more than one class period a) places a significant burden upon your laboratory partner(s); b) prevents you from gaining applied experience, a major goal of this class and c) disrupts the continuity needed to complete multi-week experiments.  Therefore, we allow one absence in this class, without an authorized excuse. Points will be deduction from your participation performance.

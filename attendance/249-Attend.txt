Attendance and class participation are required. Students who miss a class should immediately contact fellow students for lecture notes and assignments, and will be expected to submit assignments at the regular set deadlines. More than 4 unexcused absences from lecture, and 4 unexcused absences from weekly labs/discussion sessions may result in an automatic lowering of the final score by one letter grade.

Students are encouraged to attend class either in person or by zoom as is consistent with their comfort level. If must miss class, please contact an instructor as far in advance as possible, but at least 24 hours, if you know you will miss class. For any absence, excused or unexcused, you must talk with the instructor about a plan for making up work that you missed, as well as coordinate with your lab partner to exchange data.

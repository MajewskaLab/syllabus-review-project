Attendance and participation in class is expected as long as you are well. If you are sick or need to quarantine, please do not come to class. In that scenario, we will work with you to ensure that you donâ€™t fall behind on course content. Typically, you will not be able to make-up any in-class activities unless you have an excused absence. There may be times where you have to miss class for a variety of legitimate reasons (e.g, other commitment, illness). I have structured the class and grading to minimize the impacts of missing class for legitimate reasons. You can miss a certain amount of class (see below) and still earn full credit. You do not need to let me know you are missing class unless you need an accommodation or extension. If you miss class, use the slides and other resources posted eLC to learn about what you missed.

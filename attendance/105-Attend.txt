Although attendance will not be taken, class absences will result in not having data from which to write up the lab reports and will result in a reduction in your grade if not excused. If you need to be absent because you or someone you have been exposed to has tested positive to covid, or because you are exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, please inform Dr. Kushner, Shaun, and your lab partner immediately so we can make arrangements to ensure your experiments are completed and you get the data to write your lab report. If you have to be absent from class for reasons other than COVID, please inform Dr. Kushner, Shaun, and your lab partner at least one week in advance.

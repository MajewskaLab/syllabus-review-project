Attendance for all class sessions is mandatory. If for some reason you cannot attend a specific class session in-person, please email me with a valid reason for your absence before noon (12:00pm) on the day of the class. Once I approve your absence, I mayprovide you with a copy of the lecture video. Class participation comprises 20% of your final grade, so unexcused absences can severely impact your grade!

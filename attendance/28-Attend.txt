Although attendance will not be taken attendance is encouraged. If you miss an exam, you will 
receive a zero for that exam. Only documented cases of personal illness, University business, or 
family emergencies or events (e.g., death, grave illness,) will be accommodated. For 
documented cases of excused absence, accommodations may be reached or subsequent exams 
will be pro-rated (i.e. your remaining exams will count for more points). Please discuss your 
personal situation with one us as soon as possible! 
If circumstances during the semester lead to an extended absence we will try to accommodate 
you and help you to make up for missed assignments as best we can. Please bear in mind that 
students who are experiencing difficulties may withdraw from the course at any time with no 
academic penalty. This can be initiated by the student up to the regular withdrawal deadline. 
After the regular withdrawal deadline students may still avail themselves of a hardship 
withdrawal by contacting the office of Student Care and Outreach.

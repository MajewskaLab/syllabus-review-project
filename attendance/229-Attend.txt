Attendance to class is expected. You are responsible for all class material and in-class announcements whether you are present or not. 
Your presence in class is likely to impact your performance on exams. In addition, your presence in class is required in order to receive credit for participation. Participation assignments will be unannounced and cannot be made up. There will be many of these assignments and two missed participation assignments will be dropped for all students, regardless of the reason for the absence. If extenuating circumstances cause you to miss many classes during the semester, please contact me so that we can discuss your options.

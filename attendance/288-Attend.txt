Lecture: This class is planned to be in person but if you need to be off campus please let instructor know and zoom or recorded options will be available. Participation is expected for discussion assignments â€“ either virtually or in-person.
Lab: To maintain appropriate distancing the labs will be divided into 4 sections (no more than 4 students each); you will be assigned to a section following drop/add and you will have a schedule for in person and on-line work.

We have designed the course to minimize the impact of absences. For instance, you can
miss a quiz and a discussion board post and still earn full credit in the course. You can also choose to
take an optional final exam to replace your three lowest post case quiz scores. If you are going to miss
a quiz or discussion board post due to illness, authorized representation of the University, or
extraordinary personal circumstances, please notify the instructors as soon as possible so we can figure
out a reasonable way for you to make up the work and stay up-to-speed on class material.

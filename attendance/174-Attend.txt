Attendance:  This course is taught by three faculty, each covering 1/3 of the course, and details of how each section will be available will be announced in advance.  In the initial section of the course, you may choose to attend in person or you can attend by Zoom (link below).  You do not have to notify Dr. Champagne of your choice.  If you choose to attend by Zoom, you will have to do so at the scheduled lecture times as recordings of the lectures will not generally be posted for later viewing.  If you have to miss a lecture for a legitimate reason, a recording may be made available at the discretion of the instructor.

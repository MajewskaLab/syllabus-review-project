Attendance is expected and missing class too frequently can negatively impact your grade. I will not provide class materials to students who are absent. If you miss class, you are responsible for obtaining the notes (and whatever other information you missed) from a classmate. Please DON’T expect a response to emails asking me if you “missed anything.”  Any credit that was earned on the missed day (e.g. quiz grade, participation, et cetera) will not be available to you if you miss class without a valid medical or University-approved excuse. (All such excuses must be signed, with a printed name and phone number of an individual I can contact to verify your absence on that date. Fabrication or falsification of these documents constitutes academic dishonesty and will be forwarded to the Office of the Vice-President for Instruction where you will face charges.) If you miss fewer than 10% of all class meetings, your grade will not be negatively impacted by an occasional absence. This equates to about 3 or 4 absences over the course of the semester. However, do note that if you are physically present, but you are consistently distracted with extraneous diversions (e.g. surfing the web, texting, reading the newspaper, working crossword puzzles, et cetera), you will still fail to receive credit for that day if I notice it.

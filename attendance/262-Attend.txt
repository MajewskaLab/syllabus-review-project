As writing improves with regular reading and practice over time, it is crucial that students participate actively. For some classes, I will meet with students individually or in small groups to discuss writing. I will take attendance for class meetings and for student meetings. If you miss class for a legitimate reason (interview for graduate school, sickness, etc.), those absences will not affect your Participation grade (within reason), if you keep up with the rest of the class.

Your participation grade will be determined by your absences and your participation in class, including your engagement in discussions and the thoroughness of your peer reviews. If you miss class, it is your responsibility to find out what you missed and to make up your work. Workshop participation requires that you bring work in progress to most sessions.

Attendance is mandatory. Exams questions will be taken from the information covered during the lectures and breakout sessions, as well as the assigned reading material. It is very important that you attend each lecture and take good notes. Lectures will be easier for you to understand if the section we are discussing is read prior to class. You will be responsible for all announcements made in class and the eLC. Arrive on time and avoid leaving early

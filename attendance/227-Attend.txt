Attendance alone will not affect your grade; however, you are responsible for all information communicated in class. In some classes I will specify important information or go over material in a way that is not presented in the textbook. If you miss a class, you must get this information from one of your classmates. Do not e-mail me or come to my office and ask what you missed or if I can re-teach you something

Because this is a discussion/analysis course, your attendance is essential. You must plan to be present at every class. It is not easy to “get the notes” from someone if you miss a class. There are no lectures, virtually no Powerpoints, and you cannot refer to eLC to make up for missing an opportunity to participate in class and listen to your student colleagues. For you to benefit maximally from the teaching methods used in the class, you must be present and prepared. Attendance will be taken.
If you have personal obligations that will make it impossible for you to be in class every Tuesday and Thursday(unless you are ill), then you should NOT take this class this semester.

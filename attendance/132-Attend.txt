Attendance in lecture is strongly encouraged as material covered and emphasized in class will be the basis for the quizzes and exams. We recognize, however, that we are in the middle of a massive COVID-19 surge as of this writing, and that you may come down with symptoms or test positive for COVID-19. In either of those cases, please temporarily refrain from coming to lecture and rely on the recorded Kaltura videos that we are offering as a backup. Note, however, that the Kaltura videos may not be able to capture everything that takes place in the classroom.

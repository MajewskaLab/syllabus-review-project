Attendance comprises an important part of our classroom experience and is mandatory.  Each unexcused absence will result in 4 points being deducted from your overall grade for the discussion portion of the course.  Please document illness with a note from the health center or your physician.  Document team activities or interviews with notes from coaches, copies of your invitation, etc.  Punctuality is also essential. If you are over 10 minutes late, 2 points will be deducted from your overall grade for the discussion portion of the course.  Tardiness greater than 30 minutes will be considered an unexcused absence.  On days you are presenting, you will receive a zero for the assignment for an unexcused absence.

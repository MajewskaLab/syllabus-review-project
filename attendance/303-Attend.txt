**I reserve the right to execute an “instructor initiated withdrawal” for students who do not attend**
	Attendance is critical to doing well in this class.  100 pts is based on participation, quizzes and homework, and you must come to class to receive full credit for these.  Thus, you cannot receive an A simply by coming to exams.  Furthermore, class handouts only serve as a template for note taking, handouts do not replace lecture, and there is no textbook.  Students who regularly skip this class typically do not do well.
	Also, please be on time for lecture.  It is very distracting to both the students and the instructor to have students coming in late.

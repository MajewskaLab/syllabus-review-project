In person attendance is expected and because we will be in a small classroom you are also expected to wear a facemask at all times when in the classroom.  If you are feeling poorly or have been exposed to someone with COVID please DO NOT COME TO CLASS.  All classes will be recorded via Zoom and will be made available to all students.

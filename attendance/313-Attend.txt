You are allowed no unexcused absences; 100 points will be deducted from your final grade for every unexcused absence. Excused absences are only absences for which you have a University-approved excuse to miss a class (i.e. doctorâ€™s excuse that says you were too sick to attend class on the day that you missed or a University-approved activity such as competition in a UGAsponsored event.) If you have professional school interviews, you must arrange in advance with Dr. Neidle or Dr. Hoover to miss any lab classes.

All sessions will meet in the Science Learning Center, Room 302 unless otherwise announced. Our limited class size will allow us to meet face-to-face for all sessions while maintaining physical distance, in accordance with UGA COVID-19 guidelines. In addition to social distancing in the classroom, you can further reduce your risk of COVID-19 by getting vaccinated or, if you are unvaccinated, continuing to wear a face covering inside campus buildings. If our class format must changes in response to COVID-19 dynamics on campus or in Athens, updates will be posted to eLC.

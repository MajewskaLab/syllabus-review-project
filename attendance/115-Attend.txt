All students are expected to attend all course lectures and take good notes. While attendance is not mandatory, there is a participation grade. Outlines of lectures will be available on the web via eLC to simplify note-taking. However, the lecture notes on the eLC course page should not be regarded as a substitute for coming to class. 
You will be responsible for all content and instructions given during the lecture and announcements made in class (including on days when you miss a class). Arrive on time and avoid leaving early. Please turn off all cell phones and pagers.

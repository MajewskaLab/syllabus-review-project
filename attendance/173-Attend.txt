This course will be instructed in a hybrid synchronous environment. That is, lectures will be presented in real-time face-to-face in the SLC auditorium, following social distancing guidelines that allow students the opportunity to attend in-person every other lecture (based on last name):
Last Names A – P: Thursdays
Last Names P – Z: Tuesdays
On the days in which you do not have an in-person option, you should attend class live via Zoom (Zoom link on eLC). All lectures will be recorded and posted on eLC. Live attendance during lectures (either in person or on Zoom), will not be mandatory, although is strongly encouraged. In the event that you have a strong desire to attend every class in person, please contact the instructors, and if social distancing guidelines permit, we would allow attendance for all lectures.

I will be taking attendance regularly for my own records, and in hopes of learning everyone's name. As attendance is not a part of your grade, I expect that if you attend my class, you will be paying attention and will remain on task. If I find you on your cell phone or otherwise off task, I will ask you to leave my classroom

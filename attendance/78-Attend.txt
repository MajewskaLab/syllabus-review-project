You must be present in class to receive these points. If you have an excused absence, send me documentation to be excused from that day's points. You will be most successful in this class if you attend class in person so please make every effort to attend. Do NOT come to class if you have a fever or experiencing any COVID-like symptoms. If you are unable to make it to class, you can still join in with your group to work on the case using Top Hat Community's video chat or other app.

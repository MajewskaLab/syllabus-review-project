As per UGA policy for Fall 2021, we are meeting IN PERSON, Tuesdays and Thursdays. Whether or not you are vaccinated, in light of the Delta variant, I encourage you to wear your mask to class. HEPA filters are installed in classrooms as well to help with air quality. I will be wearing my mask during class and in-person office hours for the time being.  All quizzes, exams and assignments will be done during class time.  Makeups for any missed in-class activities, quizzes or exams will be only given for excused absences such as documented illness, family emergencies and academic activities.

Attendance in lab is mandatory and you will receive a zero for any experiment you fail to complete. In the event that an emergency (documented illness, death in the family, etc.) causes you to be absent from lab, it is your responsibility to arrange to make up the missed lab assignments. Students who miss 4 labs and do not have valid excuses will fail the course. Please do not schedule doctorâ€™s appointments, interviews, advising, etc. during class. These are not excused absences.

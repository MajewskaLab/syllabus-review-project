Attendance in classes and breakout sessions is mandatory; it will be monitored regularly and will be taken into consideration for assignment of final grades. Make-up exams, quizzes and breakout activities will be offered only in cases of an unusual crisis such as serious illness that results in hospitalization (being seen in the University Health Center is not sufficient). Proper documentation will be required and subject to verification by the Dean of Student Affairs.

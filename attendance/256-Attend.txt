While the need for students to quarantine or isolate due to COVID-19 will continue, students are expected to attend class in Life Sciences C127. Students who are showing infectious disease symptoms or have other legitimate excuses for not attending class in C127 must send an email to Dr. Pierce prior to class. A specific Zoom link for the class in question will be sent to the student. Powerpoint presentations from each class will be posted on eLC. A good strategy is to take notes in class during the presentations and then review these with the posted slide presentations.

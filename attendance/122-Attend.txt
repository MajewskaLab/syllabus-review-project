It is essential that students attend all lectures and discussion groups, having completed the required readings and assignments beforehand. Timeliness is expected at all events. Any absence will require a written explanation due no later than the following day, and it is the prerogative of the instructor to consider the absence excused or unexcused, or to request additional information or documentation. The instructor may require an additional assignment for missed events.

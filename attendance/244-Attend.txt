Attendance at class is strongly encouraged. Attendance will be graded on a present/absent basis every session. The relative balance of P/A marks will help determine plus and minus designations at the end of the semester (if you do not attend the majority of classes, a minus is generally ensured; if you attend most classes, a plus is possible). There will be a seating chart to facilitate attendance recording

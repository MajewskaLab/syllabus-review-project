Attendance will not be taken or graded in this class. I highly encourage everyone to attend every class session. Students who attend class regularly tend to perform better in the course compared to their non-attending classmates (Bowman, 2009). If significant amounts of students are not in attendance, there may be extra credit points given, but this will be at my discretion. If you miss a class, please be sure to get notes from your peers. You do not need to inform me if you are going to miss a class, unless it is an exam day.  
Tardiness will only hinder your ability to meet course objectives. If you arrive late, you will be responsible for obtaining any information that has already been presented, and you should enter the room with as little distraction as possible. Be responsible and arrive on time.

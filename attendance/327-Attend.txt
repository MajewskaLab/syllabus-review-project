Students are expected to attend class regularly. Excessive absences may well result in dismissal at the discretion of Dr. Langford. Missing a test or an exam results in a “make-up” (IF excused) oral or timely written essay examination (not Scantron® graded). Timely and valid excuses/reasons must be provided. Prior e-mail notice of absence to instructor is expected. Unexcused absence for tests and final exam will result in a zero. It is quit e difficult to do well on tests and exams without attending class, listening well, and efficiently taking notes for later study. Students who miss class should not ask the instructor to repeat the lecture, but have discussion with a trusted reliable classmate AND study eLC and resources posted in syllabus. Questions in class are encouraged.!!! Roll will be taken @ times, but not daily.

Students are expected to arrive every class period and stay for the entire duration. Attendance and punctuality in this class are mandatory. Due to space limitations there are no in-person make-up laboratory activities offered. Of course, unexpected events may arise forcing a student to be absent such as professional school interviews, family emergency, illness, etc. A maximum of 3 absences are allowed (either excused, unexcused, or a combination
thereof). No penalty will be applied for an excused absence however, an excused absence will. The first unexcused absence will result in a 1% penalty applied to a student’s final grade. The second unexcused absence will result in a 2% penalty applied to a student’s final grade. The third unexcused absence will result in a 3% penalty applied to a student’s final grade. The 4th unexcused absence will result in an automatic fail for the course.

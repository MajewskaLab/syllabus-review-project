Attendance is not required; however, you may not make up any work that you miss due to an absence or tardiness. Exceptions are as follows:
You may make up Exam 1 and Exam 2 if the following criteria are met
You must notify me ahead of time with a legitimate excuse and documentation
I must approve your reason before class
Assignments that are supposed to be submitted via ELC will still be accepted regardless of absence

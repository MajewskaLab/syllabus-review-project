Due to the small class size, attendance in-person is expected with the exception for medical concerns including quarantine. All quizzes, exams, and assignments will be done during class time. Recorded class sessions and makeups for any missed in-class activities, quizzes, or exam will be only given for excused absences such as documented illness, family emergencies, and academic activities. 10 points will be deducted for each unexcused absence.

Attendance Policy: 

Attendance and hands-on experiments are required. You will work on a research project and thus the experiments you do in one lab session are built on the work in a previous lab session. So if you are to miss one lab, you would then not be able to continue to do your work as do other students in the next lab. Therefore, you are required to attend each lab and perform experiments as planned with other students. 

Exceptions: if you are seriously ill (with written proof from doctors stating that you are too ill to attend the lab) or have family emergency (with valid proof) or some circumstances beyond your control, you may be excused to miss labs. Please e-mail me promptly if you happen to face these situations so that I may arrange to continue your missing experiments, and do not wait until after you miss a lab unless circumstances prevent you to do so.

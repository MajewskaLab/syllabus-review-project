While attendance is not mandatory for this course, you are responsible for all the information communicated in class. In some classes, important information concerning assignments will be provided, and new material may be covered that is not available in the textbook. All material covered in the lectures is fair game for the exams, so it is in your best interest to attend class regularly. If you miss a class, you must get this information from one of your classmates. The instructor will not re-teach you material covered during missed class, nor will we provide you with lecture notes.

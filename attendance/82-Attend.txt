While attendance is not recorded, it is required. Exam questions will be taken from information covered during lectures and breakouts. To help you focus on the important material in the lecture, we recommend reading over the associated study questions prior to class. You will be responsible for all announcements made in class or through ELC E-mail. Arrive on time and avoid leaving early. Turn off cell phones. This includes no email or texting during class. If you distract the other students, then you will be asked to leave classroom. In the event of weather related cancellation of classes, the schedule will pick up the sequence of lectures as classes resume.

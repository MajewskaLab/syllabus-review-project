If a student must miss an exam due to sickness, the student must follow the policies defined by the University and inform the instructor, either directly or through the University Student Affairs office, of the situation prior to the exam being given. Documentation supporting the reasons for the absence will be required. In cases of COVID infections, follow current university guidelines. Do not come to class sick. An unexcused absence from an exam will result in a zero for that exam. Makeup exams for excused absences only will be rescheduled and may include any format of question, including possibly all essay format, at the discretion of the instructor(s) that are responsible for the content covered. When multiple students miss an examination, the same exam will be used for all absent students and it will be given at the same time, possibly utilizing Respondus Monitor.

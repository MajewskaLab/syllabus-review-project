Attendance in laboratory is mandatory.  You must attend laboratory and complete All assignments.  You will receive a grade of zero for any exercise you fail to complete.  In the event that an extreme emergency (documented illness, death in the family, etc.) causes you to be absent from lab, it is your responsibility to arrange a make-up assignment or reassignment to another lab section. Students who miss 4 labs and do not have a valid excuse will be dropped from the course.

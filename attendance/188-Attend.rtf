\f0\fs22 \cf2 \cb3 It is important that students keep pace with the material in class. We have developed the class to maximize the value of in-person class time. Pre-recorded lectures and posted readings give students enhanced flexibility about how to organize their time. In person classroom sessions will be active, including discussions, Q&A, worked examples, in-class homework and project development. If a student is unable to attend a classroom session, we ask that they check in with instructors as soon as possible thereafter (beginning with an email) so that they catch up with material. They should also check in with their project group. \

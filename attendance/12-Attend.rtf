\f0\fs24 \cf0 Attendance in class is essential. There may be times you will have to miss class because of an emergency or other commitment. We have structured the grading in this course to minimize the impact of missing a class for legitimate reasons by allowing you to miss up to 10% of the in-\'ad\uc0\u8208 class questions and still earn full credit, and allowing 1 dropped assignment, 1 dropped eLC quiz, and 1 dropped solo exam, and 1 dropped group exam. Weekly quizzes, in-\'ad\u8208 class questions, and exams cannot be made up under any circumstances. You do not need to email the instructor to report an absence, unless it is an exam day.}

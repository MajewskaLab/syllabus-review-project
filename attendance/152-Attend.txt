Attendance in-person during lab is required each week. Since labs only meet once per week, missing even one session means you have missed a substantial amount of course material. DO NOT schedule other appointments or activities that overlap with your lab section. 
If you have TWO unexcused absences or THREE total (excused + unexcused) absences during the semester, you will receive an “F” in the lab due to incompletion of the course. If you find yourself in a situation whereby you anticipate having excessive absences, please contact the Lab Coordinator as soon as possible to discuss potential solutions.

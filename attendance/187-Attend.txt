Attendance is essential. If you miss a class, you are responsible for contacting fellow students for lecture notes. More than 4 unexcused absences will result in a lowering of your final score by one letter grade. An excused absence is constituted by the student notifying the instructor in advance and producingproof for reason of absence immediately upon return to the class.

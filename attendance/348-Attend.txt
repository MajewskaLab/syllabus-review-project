Any student who cannot attend their lab session should contact their TA immediately for approval of absence. TAs will approve all reasonable reasons for class absence. TA will request documentation of reason for absence if graded work is missed. Unapproved absences will result in 5pts per instance being deducted from final laboratory grade. Missed assignments can be made-up with permission of the TA (documentation of reason for absence required). Any unresolved grade concerns regarding absences or missed work should be directed to F.Scott.

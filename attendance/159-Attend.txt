Punctual attendance in the lab is required. Arrive on time and avoid leaving early. If you must miss a lab period, it is your responsibility to arrange to make up the class in the same week. You will be responsible for all content and instructions given during the lab and announcements made in class (including on days when you miss a class). Medical/professional school interviews will be counted as excused absences only if Dr. Paz is contacted prior to the absence.

Students will be required to attend class and laboratory activities at various times throughout the course of the day. For example, several times during the program we will document bird populations and their behavior, often beginning at 5:30am. Similarly, we may be found characterizing nocturnal animal communities at midnight. In order to cover the widest range of tropical ecology topics feasible, most days will be very long, and we will be spending over 90 hours together in either the class setting or field locations exploring Costa Ricaâ€™s tropical ecosystems. Your attention and active engagement will be required throughout this very challenging Maymester.

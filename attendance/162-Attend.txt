To achieve the highest grades in this class, regular in-person attendance is expected. Attendance is assessed by quizzes in each module, based on the lecture or reading material, together comprising 20% of your final grade. In the event that you display COVID-like symptoms, we ask you to stay home, get tested, and email the class TA in advance of the class so arrangements can be made to make up any missed quizzes. If you do test positive, stay at home for 5 days following this result - do not attend class during this period even if you feel OK. For serious illnesses or other crises that result in you missing multiple classes, we will ask you to contact the TA and instructor(s) for the classes you have missed. Note that we may need to ask you to provide proof of the emergency (such as a doctorâ€™s note) to the class TA.

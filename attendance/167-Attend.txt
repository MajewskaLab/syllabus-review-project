Attendance will be assessed in lab and lecture throughout the semester and will constitute 10% of the final course grade. If you have a legitimate excuse, you must show written documentation no later than the next class meeting you are present. If you are not present when attendance is taken you will be counted absent. Attendance grades will be calculated as the percentage of times you are present out of the total number of times attendance was taken. No make-up of work (e.g., quizzes or exams) missed due to absence or tardiness will be allowed without a written excuse.

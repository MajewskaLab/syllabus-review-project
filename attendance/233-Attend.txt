Attendance and preparation for class are expected. You are responsible for all class content and announcements whether you are present or not. It is important that you complete reading assignments before coming to class. There is not time in lecture to cover everything discussed in the readings; lectures will be used to highlight important topics and go into more depth on difficult concepts, as well as having discussions, watching video clips, etc. Lectures may also cover material not covered directly in the readings.

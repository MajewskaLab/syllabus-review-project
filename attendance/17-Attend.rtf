\f0\fs22 \cf0 Attendance in class is essential for your learning in this course. Showing up for class (and being on time) is part of your responsibility as a self-regulated learner. However, I am well aware there may be times you will have to miss class due to an emergency, illness, or other commitment. Since there is no way to make up in-class participation points if you are absent, I have structured the grading to minimize the impact of missing a class for a legitimate reason: you are allowed to miss up to 10% of in-class questions and notecard activities and still earn full credit for your In-Class Participation grade. \
If you miss class, use the slides and other resources posted to eLC to learn about what you missed. I will NOT respond to emails with the question \'93What did I miss in class?\'94 It is your responsibility to figure out what you missed in class using the resources on eLC and talking with your classmates. However, remember you can always come to Student Hours to chat about any course material you have confusions about, as long as you have put in a good effort trying to understand it on your own first (with the help of eLC and your classmates of course). }

Attendance is important for this learning in this class. We design class to provide opportunities 
for you to work individually and in groups to practice working toward the learning objectives. You 
may have a hard time doing well on exams if you are not in class the majority of the time. We 
will not take attendance in this class, but you will have an in-class assignment due for each 
class period.

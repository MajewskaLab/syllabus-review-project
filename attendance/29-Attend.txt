The course content and discussions will be tailored to build on your existing 
knowledge and address your questions and concerns, so your attendance is essential. There will 
be times you will may to miss class because of an illness, emergency, or other professional or 
academic commitment. I have structured the grading in this course to minimize the impact of 
8
missing a class for legitimate reasons. You will be allowed to miss up to 10% of participation 
points and still earn full credit for your participation score (i.e., everyone has a 10% buffer for 
that part of their grade). What to do when you miss class: 
o If you are ill, please stay home! This limits the spread of any illness and allows you to rest 
so you can recover more quickly. First you should review all class materials (lecture 
recordings and slides) that you missed, which will be posted to eLC. After reviewing on 
your own, you are also encouraged to contact a classmate to figure out what you missed 
and get their notes from class. Classes will NOT be live-streamed via Zoom, but they will 
be recorded and posted to eLC at the end of each day. See COVID-specific details below if
applicable. If you miss an exam for a legitimate reason, you must contact me within 24 
hours to schedule a make-up exam, and the make-up exam must be taken within one 
week from the original exam date.
o If you know in advance that you are going to miss an exam or other assignment due to 
illness, authorized representation of the University, or extraordinary personal 
circumstances, please notify me as soon as possible in advance of the day(s) you 
anticipate missing. Please provide documentation for your absence and we will work 
together to reschedule the exam or assignment due dates.

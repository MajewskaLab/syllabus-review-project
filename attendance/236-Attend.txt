Attendance is not part of your grade, but it is strongly recommended that you come to every class. You are responsible for all lecture material, announcements, in-class work, and quizzes from any class that you miss. That includes announcements regarding assignments, readings, changes to the syllabus, etc.  If you miss class please check eLC or contact a fellow student for any important updates.  DO NOT email me to inquire about what was covered that day, I will not respond.

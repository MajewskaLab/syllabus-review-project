Attendance: While attendance is not recorded, it is required. Exam questions will be taken from information covered during lectures, breakouts, and case studies. To help you focus on the important material in the lectures, we recommend reading over the associated study questions, assigned reading, and/or case studies prior to class. You will be responsible for all announcements made in class or through ELC E-mail. Arrive on time and avoid leaving early. In the event of weather-related cancellation of classes, the schedule will pick up the sequence of lectures as classes resume.

Class attendance and participation for the ENTIRE time of each session is required for each weekly session.  Anyone found using electronic devices for other than legitimate class purposes (excepting emergencies), as taking notes or searching the Internet regarding an issue raised in class, will be counted absent/unexcused.  (No social media, surfing the Internet, texting, etc.)

Requests for excusing an absence must be presented by e-mail to Dr. Langford (BIOL 2900, alangfor@uga.edu) or Dr. Eisner (BIOL 3990,	deisner@uga.edu) in a timely and written fashion,
before class (unless not possible). In the event that Dr. Eisner fully retires, these e-mails should be sent to Dr. Langford.  If absence is excused, then a ‘make-up’ homework must be generated by attending another biolife/health/disease seminar on campus (usually one with a guest speaker).
(check UGA campus calendar, departmental websites, campus newpaper, etc.)  during the semester and summarizing the presentation in writing. These ‘make-up’ homeworks are due by NOON two weeks after last class session (#10) is held.

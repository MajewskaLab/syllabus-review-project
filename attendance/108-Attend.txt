Attendance: Students are expected to attend all classes for the full length of the class period â€“ either in person or via ZOOM. An important part of learning in this class is student engagement during in-class activities, so we will be recording attendance (both in-person and online classrooms) for the purpose of assigning extra-credits. Students who have less than 3 unexcused absences will earn 12 extra credit points towards their final grade.
Note:
i. If you are sick, please do not come to in-person class; use the online option instead.
ii. Attendance for both in-person and online classrooms will be recorded starting the second class. Leaving class early unexcused will not accrue attendance credit.
iii. Written excuses, including academic or medical, will only be considered if they are delivered to the instructors before the class or within one week after the class missed.

As a 1 credit course scheduled once a week, student success will be highly dependent on theengagement and participation in the class meetings and completing the asynchronousassignments in their entirety. Missing even one class means that you have missed a significantportion of the course and attendance will be recorded for the face to face and synchronousmeeting labs.If you are absent from class (in lab or synchronous) it is your responsibility to contactyour GLA within 48 hours after the absence for content and assignment information.You must also provide valid documentation of the absence. You will still be expected tosubmit assignments on the posted due date unless approval has been received by theLab Coordinator for a late submission. Valid excuses encompass:sickness/hospitalization (this includes COVID quarantine/isolation), family death, UGAassociated academic/athletic events (this does not include advising appointments,practice sessions, or general meetings).If you have contacted your GLA and submitted valid excuse documentation of your absence tothe drop box in eLC within 2 days after the absence, that will be recorded as an excusedabsence. Failure to contact your GLA within the 2-day time period, or failure to submitappropriate documentation, will result in an unexcused absence and 10 points will be deductedfrom your total point score for the course.*Students that have 3 or more absences will receive an F due to incompletion of the course*ALL absences, excused or unexcused, count toward the absence total.

While attendance is not mandatory for this course, you are responsible for all the information communicated in class. In some classes, important information concerning assignments will be provided, and new material may be covered that is not available in the textbook. All material covered in the lectures is fair game for the exams, so it is in your best interest to attend class regularly. If you miss a class, you must get the information covered from one of your classmates. The instructor and TA will not re-teach you material covered during missed classes, nor will we provide you with lecture notes. Additionally, promptness, preparedness, and participation in class WILL be considered for the final grade (see Class Participation, above). There is no other way to earn these participation points besides attending class. 
Even though attendance is not mandatory, the instructor(s) will keep a record of attendance and participation. A good attendance record will be useful for students with borderline grades (e.g.,89%, 79%, 69%). Thus, if a student has obtained a borderline final grade, we will use attendance as a way of deciding that person's letter grade for the class (i.e., an excellent attendance record will likely result in the higher grade).

The course content and discussions will be tailored to build on your existing knowledge and address your questions and concerns, so your attendance is essential. There will be times you will may to miss class because of an illness, emergency, or other professional or academic commitment. I have structured the grading in this course to minimize the impact of missing a class for legitimate reasons. What to do when you miss class:
- If you are ill, please stay home! This limits the spread of any illness and allows you to rest so you can recover more quickly. Assignments, quizzes, and Top Hat questions cannot be submitted late, but your grade will not suffer because you can miss an assignment, a quiz, and 10% of Top Hat questions without penalty. If you miss an exam, you will earn a zero for the exam and you can take the final exam to replace the zero with your final exam score. You do not need to provide a doctorâ€™s note or notify the instructor. You should contact a classmate to figure out what you missed and get their notes from class. See COVID-specific details below.
- If you know in advance that you are going to miss an exam or other assignment due to illness, authorized representation of the University, or extraordinary personal circumstances, please notify me as soon as possible in advance of the day(s) you anticipate missing. Please provide documentation for your absence and we will work together to reschedule the exam or assignment due dates

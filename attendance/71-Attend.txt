Attendance is mandatory. Exam questions will be taken from information covered during lecture as well as the assigned reading material. It is very important that you attend lecture and take good notes. Each lecture will be easier for you to understand if the section we are discussing is read prior to class. You will be responsible for all announcements made in class. Arrive on time and avoid leaving early. Please turn off all cell phones and other electronic devices.

ATTENDANCE: Attendance of each class meeting is required. There will be discussions and activities in which all students are expected to participate. Student learning will be maximized by attending class regularly and participating fully in all discussions and activities. All students should be prepared to be called on to comment on the topic at hand. While it is understood that campus transport sometimes makes timely movement across campus between classes
difficult, arrival to class later than 11:10 AM or departure prior to 12:05 PM may result in a missed in-class assignment (and therefore receiving a zero for that work). There will be no exceptions unless cleared with Dr. Moore. If you are absent on a day when a test is administered or an assignment is due, you must present a formal doctor’s excuse to Dr. Moore (a nurse’s excuse from the Health Center will NOT suffice) or other record of professional commitment (such as a formal letter of invitation for a job or graduate education interview). If your excuse is unacceptable, you receive a zero for participation or any work that is given/due on that day. If you are very ill or have a family emergency and are unable to attend your classes, you must contact the Office of Student Affairs, 542-8220, which will then inform all of your instructors. This is the only acceptable avenue for being excused from a presentation, assignment submission or exam for grave illness or family emergency. You are responsible for making this contact.

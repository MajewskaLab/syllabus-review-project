Attendance in lab and lab lecture is mandatory.  If you miss lab or are excessively tardy (>10 min) and you MUST provide your TA with acceptable documentation in order to for the absence/tardy to be considered excused (see below).

If you must miss a lab period, it is your responsibility to 1) contact your TA directly to make review arrangements and, 2) provide documentation of a valid excuse directly to your TA.  Failure to comply with either of these processes will result in an ‘unexcused’ absence and loss of credit for assignments/quizzes.  

If you miss class the period (or are excessively tardy to a lab period) in which a homework/in-class assignment or quiz is either given or collected and do NOT provide a documented excused absence– you will NOT receive credit for the assignment/quiz.
